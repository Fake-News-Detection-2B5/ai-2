f2182a54,HUGE! Attorney Sidney Powell CONFIRMS Alleged Dominion Servers in Germany Were Confiscated — VIDEO,"Last week Rep. Louie Gohmert told Chris Salcedo on Newsmax that people on the ground in Germany report that Scytl, which hosted elections data improperly through Spain, was raided by a large US ARMY force and their servers were seized in Frankfurt.  The video went viral.  Here is what Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) had to say about this alleged raid earlier today.  TRENDING: FBI Sends Out Warning Advising Against Buying, Making or Misrepresenting a Vaccine Card Which May Be ""Breaking the Law""  We later posted more information we received from our source on this raid in Germany.  From our source: The US government, once they determined that this Dominion server was involved in switching votes, then the intelligence community began a search for the server and discovered that the server was in Germany. In order to get access to that server and have it available for use in a legal manner they had to have the State Department work in tandem with the Department of Justice. They had to request that the government of Germany cooperate in allowing this seizure of this server. The appropriate documents required to affect that kind of seizure were put in place, signed off on, and it appears there was also US military support in this operation. The US military was not in the lead. But this helps explain why Esper was fired and Miller and Kash Patel were put in place — so that the military would not interfere with the operation in any way. By getting ahold of the server they now are going to have the direct evidence of when they were instructed to stop counting. They will also discover who gave the direction to stop counting and who initiated the algorithm that started switching votes. The CIA was completely excluded from this operation.

c5175d8d,Paul Ryan’s Worst Ally - The New York Times,"WHATEVER drama plays out when Republicans meet in Cleveland next week to nominate their party’s presidential candidate, the most consequential story line might well be the nationally televised debut of the awkward political partnership between Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican and thus chairman of the convention. But it offers just a sample of the spectacles sure to ensue between them should Mr. Trump become president.  How could Mr. Ryan, for years his party’s self-styled ideas guy, share power with a president whose ill-formed, often baffling ideas are in significant cases the opposite of his own, and of conservatives generally — on trade, Medicare and Social Security, immigration policy and more?  Could Mr. Ryan, as he suggests, really expect compromise from Mr. Trump, who has already served notice that Republican congressional leaders should “just be quiet” and leave running the country to him? Might Mr. Ryan even use the House’s legislative power to block some initiatives, though President Trump would be certain to claim a mandate for them? Where difficult trade-offs are needed to bring Trumpian ideas into legislative reality, can Mr. Ryan corral support from his fractious Republican colleagues (and even a few Democrats when necessary)?  That last question suggests another, bigger one that predates the Trump ascendance: Can Mr. Ryan himself compromise in the interest of getting legislation signed into law? Many in both parties have come to doubt it after 17 years in which the 46-year-old congressman from Wisconsin has held increasingly influential positions in the House, with Republicans holding a majority for all but four of those years.",true

392886ea,Antifa gearing up for false flag violence disguised as Trump-supporters,"With merchants in Democrat-run cities boarding up their storefront windows, the possibility of serious urban violence is well understood. As horrific as that could get (ask anyone who lives in Minneapolis), the progressive fascists appear to have a plan in place to make it even worse: disguising their rioters as Trump-supporters in order to make the case that Donald Trump truly is a dictator that must be violently overthrown if he wins or arrested and prosecuted if he loses.  A source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer:  What makes all of this particularly chilling is that progressives already are absurdly claiming that the threat of violence comes from our side. Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler warns of white racist rioters inspired by the rhetoric from Washington, D.C. (i.e., Trump):  Given the heightened concerns about potential violence, particularly from white supremist organizations and the divisive rhetoric from Washington, D.C., the need for coordination and partnership takes on statewide significance. Oregon is likely to be a flashpoint. — Mayor Ted Wheeler (@tedwheeler) November 2, 2020  Other media players, such Vox and the New York Times, warn of both sides, a disguise of balance but ridiculously unrealistic, considering the utter lack of property destruction by the right and massive destruction at the hands of the left since Gorge Floyd's death in police custody.  Tucker Carlson and Lisa Boothe last night addressed Ted Wheeler's warning and correctly pointed out its absurdity. As they noted, if merchants believed that white supremacists were the threat, they would not be spray-painting ""We support Black Lives Matter"" on their plywood window coverings. If they thought Ted Wheeler were for real, not a vicious liar, they would spray white power rhetoric. The segment begins at about 1:30 in the video below (courtesy of Media Matters!):  Dan Crenshaw makes a similar point:  Trump’s chaos? Last I checked, businesses weren’t boarding up their windows because they were afraid of Trump supporters. https://t.co/XALmvJ0H2t — Dan Crenshaw (@DanCrenshawTX) November 1, 2020  Speaking of Tucker C., his opening monologue last night nailed it, explaining what this election is all about.

bc6d5d55,Remarks by President Biden on the Administration’s COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts,"State Dining Room  4:22 P.M. EST  THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, folks. The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I’d like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort.  As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening — open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.  But that’s — one of my first goals in office was — when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We’ve got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we’ll make it all the way.  As I — and as I’ve said, we have a long way to go, but, you know, as I said from the outset, we’re going to use every resource of the federal government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson & Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we pote- — while we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn’t coming fast enough. So my team — my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.  As I’ve always said, this was a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches.  And today, we’re announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world — that are usually competitors — are working together on the vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two.  We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7.  In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts. And I want to thank Johnson & Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis.  Here’s what all this means: We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.  Let me say that again: When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About three weeks ago, we were able to say that we’ll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July.  And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply — I’ll say it again — for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That’s progress — important progress.  But it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans’ arms.  To date, we’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses. We’ve developed — we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come.  We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.  The federal government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It’s incredible.  And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely.  Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.  Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know.  Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.  Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for — and further undermining the health of our economy.  This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President.  To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely — reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus. All cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well.  You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It’s a roadmap that will enable schools — if they have the resources they deserve — to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I’ve asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce.  Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that.  So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service — educators, school staff, childcare workers — get them vaccinated immediately. They’re essential workers.  Over 30 states have already taken step to prior- –prioritize educators for vaccination. And today, I’m using the full authority of the federal government. I’m directing every state to do the same. My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.  To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month — the month of March, we will be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child-care workers. Throughout March, they will be able to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them.  And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week, but our goarl [sic] — goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March.  I want to conclude with this: We’re making progress from the mess we inherited. We’re moving in the right direction. And today’s announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I’d be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly.  Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks — keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I’ve asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People’s lives are at stake.  We have already — we have already — and I carry this in my pocket — lost more — as of today, we’ve lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It’s got to stop.  We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing states for their efforts.  We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now. Now.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can’t assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.  So thank you. And please, please, it’s not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much.  Q Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal?  THE PRESIDENT: When do I think things will get back to normal? I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal, and before that — my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue — continue to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There’s a lot we have to do yet. So thank you.  Q Did you receive a briefing about the border today?  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did.  Q What did you learn?  THE PRESIDENT: A lot.  Q Is there a crisis at the border, sir?  THE PRESIDENT: No, we’ll be able to handle it, God willing.  4:34 P.M. EST",partially false

b8437efb,BOMBSHELL: Covid-19 infection rate may be 440% higher among children who received FLU SHOTS… while health “authorities” madly push more shots for the coming flu season,"(Natural News) A 2012 study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases finds that children who received inactivated influenza vaccines were 440% more likely (relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8) to acquire infections of respiratory viral pathogens which are not influenza. With the aggressive push for influenza immunizations now under way, the medical establishment may be setting up children to be extremely vulnerable to coronavirus infections.  Titled, “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine,” the study is found at this link at the National Library of Medicine:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/  The study finds that flu shots quite literally inactivate parts of the human immune system, rendering the child more vulnerable to coronavirus infections. “Being protected against influenza, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses,” the study authors write.  The study authors explain that the influenza vaccine works to prevent influenza virus infections, but at the same time it makes children more susceptible to other respiratory infections. Since the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) for seasonal influenza is so low (around 0.024%, which is not a typo), and the Infection Fatality Rate of covid-19 infections is at least one order of magnitude higher, it raises the obvious question:  Would it save more lives of children to avoid administering flu shots this year and therefore reduce their vulnerability to covid-19, which has a far higher fatality rate?  The study, which was conducted in 2009, observed the outcomes of 115 children aged 6 – 16 years. The study also used a placebo group and found that placebo made “no statistically significant difference” in the risk of acute respiratory infection risk.  But children who received influenza vaccines had a much higher risk of respiratory infections.  Even more shockingly, the study also found no difference in the risk of seasonal influenza infections between those children who were vaccinated vs. those who weren’t. In other words, the influenza vaccine offered no protection against the flu, but it created increased vulnerability to other respiratory infections. (No benefits, just increased risks.) “There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of TIV or placebo,” the study explains.  You can see the increased number of respiratory infections in this chart. Note the “TIV” column means those children who were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine:  The conclusion is that influenza vaccines make children more susceptible to other respiratory viral infections. From the study, which took place more than a decade before the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic:  We identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients (Table 3), including significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection, which were most frequently detected in March 2009, immediately after the peak in seasonal influenza activity in February 2009.  The study authors point out that the influenza vaccine, “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism,” although they also state more research is needed because some of the self-reporting of symptoms may have introduced “artifacts” which could sway the numbers. Nevertheless, the study authors also state that this phenomenon of “viral interference” is well known:  Participants who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened nonspecific immunity in the following weeks… The phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for >60 years [24–27]. Ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially explained by viral interference [3–11]… Interference in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections has been reported after receipt of live oral poliovirus vaccine [29–32].  Those who push flu shots may be worsening the coronavirus pandemic  The upshot of this research is that those who are pushing flu shots for children may in fact be worsening the coronavirus pandemic, creating “perfect storm” conditions for children to become carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus that causes covid-19.  This is consistent with the fact that we now know the medical establishment has acted to deliberately worsen covid-19 fatalities by, for example, conspiring the destroy the credibility of hydroxychloroquine, working to maximize fatalities in order to reap a windfall of profits from the coronavirus vaccine.  Yes, the medical and science establishment quite literally arranges for more people to die in order to keep the coronavirus fear alive, resulting in more demand for high-profit vaccines.  As always, it’s all about the money. As Gary Heavin recently wrote in a warning to America, Big Pharma operatives are “accessories to murder.”  How does Big Pharma have so much control over the dissemination of this information or should I say propaganda? Well, the same answer pops up again, money. Big Pharma gave $2 billion dollars during the last election cycle to US politicians. Big AG, the military/security complex and big oil each gave only a paltry $1.0 billion dollars to buy the votes of our political leadership.  The MSM counts Big Pharma’s advertising revenue at up to 80% of their income. The internet’s “masters of the universe” also kowtow to Big Pharma’s influence and advertising dollars by censoring anyone who tries to tell the American people the truth about Covid 19.  It certainly appears that anyone who is complicit in this Great Deception, a deception that is designed to kill and terrify enough people to ultimately beg for an experimental vaccine, well, these people would be accessories to murder.  Flu shots are being hyped to suppress immune systems and create an explosion in coronavirus infections  Flu shots, it seems, are one more way the medical establishment can literally murder children and adults, creating widespread vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic which will no doubt surge back this Fall as flu shots work to suppress the immune systems of millions.  Recognize that the people pushing flu shots are medical murderers, and many are deliberately trying to kill as many people as possible to create demand for the high-profit coronavirus vaccines that are about to be unleashed on America, probably before the end of this year.  It’s the perfect crime: Manufacture vaccines that suppress the immune system right in the middle of a pandemic, causing more infections and deaths, leading to more calls for mandatory vaccines. The drug companies will cash in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars while innocent children and adults all across America needlessly suffer and die.  As usual, it’s all about the money, and the vaccine / drug cartels are murderous, criminal regimes that twisted science (Dr. Fauci?) to maximize profits at any cost.

faf024d6,Marine Corps. Rebukes Pelosi: “WE DON’T WORK FOR YOU!”,"Latest Breaking News: Martial Law Imminent  General David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists.  A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.  Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.  Her statement made the general explode, our source said.  “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.  Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.  “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.  Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”  Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”  Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.  “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen. Berger allegedly told her.  Please help support alternative media. We follow the truth, wherever it leads. We reject absolutely big-tech and the narrow, dogmatic views of MSM. Although we are new to the arena, the MSM and its watchdogs–Snopes, Media Matters, Politifact, etc.–have waged war on us.

daafc154,Scott Walker still owes $1 million for presidential campaign,"Gov. Scott Walker said Friday his presidential campaign remains $1 million in the red, despite a spurt of fundraising in the final quarter of 2015. Credit: Associated Press  By of the  Madison— Scott Walker's former presidential campaign still owes more than $1 million, despite raising $500,000 in the last three months of 2015.  Also Friday, the Republican governor said he's dropping the practice his political operations adopted last year of paying for the travel costs to campaign events for Walker's state security team. Taxpayers will now, as they did before the presidential campaign, foot the costs of both the travel and salaries of the governor's security when he leaves the state for political events.  As of the end of last year, Walker's White House campaign had about $1.2 million in obligations left and about $153,000 in cash that partially offsets those debts.  Though Walker has raised nearly $8 million for his short run, his operation spent the cash faster than he could raise it over the campaign's 71-day life, and he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race in September.  A report filed Friday with federal elections officials shows the resulting burden won't be an easy one, even for the best political fundraiser in state history.  ""Governor Walker made substantial progress in addressing financial commitments over the last quarter, and he remains humbled by the outpouring of support from friends across the country who continue to believe in his common sense reform agenda,"" spokesman Joe Fadness said.  The filings show Walker still owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to a number of companies, including fundraising and communications consultants, direct mail companies, and photographers and video producers.  His highest debts include: $317,000 to FLS Connect LLC, a Minnesota-based telemarketing company; $82,000 to a Washington, D.C.-based legal consulting company, Jones Day; $70,000 to SCM Associates, a New Hampshire based direct mail printing company; $59,000 to the Lukens Co., an Arlington-based direct mail printing company; $44,000 in event staging expenses to MMA Events, a Maryland-based company; and $39,000 to an Alexandria-based video production company, Sharp Politics.  Walker also got some help from his state campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker, which purchased $14,682 of items from the presidential campaign.  And he rented his voter list to Voter Gravity Inc., and Granite Lists LLC, for $20,000 and $15,700.70, respectively.  The governor did make some progress paying off his debts in the wake of his failed presidential bid.  He had owed about $10,500 to the Waukesha County Expo Center, where he officially launched his 2016 campaign in July, but paid that bill in full.  Walker also refunded 152 contributions for a total of $407,546.24.  Walker's presidential campaign took in $2.4 million and $1.2 million during July and August. Those figures dropped off dramatically in September, with $484,521, and October, with $35,279. The campaign still managed to break six figures in individual contributions in November and December, bringing in $127,498 and $151,334, respectively.  Also Friday, Walker's affiliated Unintimidated PAC reported that it took in $3.7 million in itemized receipts in the last half of 2015. The grand majority of that money came from two families: Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein contributed $2.5 million; and Mary and Mike Shannon of Milwaukee contributed another $500,000. Richard Uihlein is CEO of Pleasant Prairie-based Uline Corp. Mike Shannon is the CEO of KSL Capital Partners.  The PAC filed termination papers Friday.  State officials also said Friday that in the future, Walker's political operations will no longer reimburse state taxpayers for his security team's travel expenses.  Walker's political operations have reimbursed state taxpayers $260,000 to cover hotel stays, airfare and other travel expenses last year for his security team. But in the future, taxpayers will have to pay such costs when state troopers accompany Walker on political trips, said Jim Dick, a spokesman for the state Department of Administration.  Walker decided last year to have his political operations pick up some of those costs while he crisscrossed the country and traveled overseas as he explored and launched his presidential campaign.  But Walker is returning to the previous practice as used by other governors of both parties. Democrat Jim Doyle, for instance, brought security along on his travels to political and other events, such as a December 2010 visit to Cancun for a United Nation climate change conference.  The Wisconsin governor was an early favorite in the Republican field after surging in the wake of a January 2015 speech in Iowa, but then began to flounder as real estate mogul Donald Trump surged and Walker had to clarify statements about birthright citizenship and building a wall on Canada's border.

The bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. As businesses reopen, many are requiring shoppers and employees to wear a face mask. Costco, for instance, will not allow shoppers into the store without wearing a face mask. Many employers are requiring all employees to wear a face mask while at work. In some jurisdictions, all citizens must wear a face mask if they are outside of their own home. ⁃ TN Editor  With the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception.  This is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness (asymptomatic) or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection—mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mainly intubation and use of a ventilator (respirator), may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals.  By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Russell Blaylock, MD  As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, “ None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”1 Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission.  It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history.  Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications.  There is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask (cloth or paper mask) in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 µm2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange (breathing) to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers (47 males and 165 females) asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2  How is Coronavirus Getting Into the Brain? Vaccine Reaction  They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation (hypoxia) or an elevation in blood C02 (hypercapnia). It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death.  A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3 Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance.  Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind—which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung.  While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels (pa02) significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels.  The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels (hypoxia) is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7  People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9 Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular (heart attacks) and cerebrovascular (strokes) diseases.10  There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number.  It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves (smell nerves), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13  It is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them.  One should not attack and insult those who have chosen not to wear a mask, as these studies suggest that is the wise choice to make.  References  bin-Reza F et al.

4461868e,Kamala Harris Says She Supports Your Second Amendment Rights. Her Record Proves Otherwise,"We knew that Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick wasn’t going to be an NRA member or a Second Amendment supporter, but that doesn’t mean he had to pick someone who actually argued in 2008 that Washington, D.C.’s ban on handguns didn’t violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala Harris signed on to an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court in the Heller case, arguing that “for nearly 70 years courts have consistently sustained criminal firearms laws against Second Amendment challenges by holding that, inter alia, (i) the Second Amendment provides only a militia-related right to bear arms, (ii) the Second Amendment does not apply to legislation passed by state or local governments, and (iii) the restrictions bear a reasonable relationship to protecting public safety and thus do not violate a personal constitutional right.”  The brief, written by Adrian Fenty (at the time the Attorney General for Washington, D.C.) urged the Supreme Court to uphold the District’s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a firearms storage law requiring guns to be kept locked up or disassembled with ammunition stored separately. To do otherwise, claimed Fenty, Harris, and several other prosecutors, would create “a broad private right to possess any firearm that is a ‘lineal descendant’ of a founding era weapon and that is in ‘common use’ with a ‘military application’ today.”  Create a right. In other words, Kamala Harris told the Supreme Court that Americans didn’t have an individual right to possess a firearm that is in common use, turning a right of the people into a privilege to be exercised by a chosen few.  Harris lost the argument in 2008, but she’s been opposing the right to keep and bear arms ever since. As District Attorney, Harris demanded an end to gun shows at the Cow Palace convention center just outside of the San Francisco city limits, and as California’s Attorney General she not only defended the state’s gun control laws in court, but according to California Rifle & Pistol Association president Chuck Michel, she failed to properly oversee several databases that the state uses to determine whether or not someone is eligible to own a firearm.  .. not one but two separate Reports from the California State Auditor have found serious problems with the way the DOJ processes mental health records to determine a person’s firearm eligibility. Despite these multiple admonitions, Harris has failed to fix the problems. A 2013 Report from the California State Auditor found that under Harris, the DOJ “had not sufficiently reached out to the courts or mental health facilities to remind them to promptly report required information,” which if done would have allowed the DOJ to determine when dangerously mentally ill persons were in possession of firearms or attempting to purchase them. Additionally, this report found that: [K]ey decisions, such as whether a person is prohibited, are left to staff whose work does not receive a supervisory review. Because of these issues, Justice cannot identify all armed prohibited persons in California as effectively as it should, and the information it uses to ensure public safety by confiscating firearms is incomplete.  As U.S. Senator, Kamala Harris has backed bans on so-called assault weapons, universal background check mandates, and more, but it was her short-lived presidential campaign that really allowed her to once again tout her anti-gun agenda. Harris proclaimed that if she was elected president, she would enact gun control with or without the support of Congress.  “Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. We need action, and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I’m elected, I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, because it is time to act.”  Expect the media to highlight the fact that Harris says she owns a gun, in order to portray her as some sort of “moderate” on the issue of the right to keep and bear arms. She’s not a moderate. She’s a hypocrite. Here’s what she told a CNN townhall audience last April.  “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety,” the California Democrat said Thursday. “I was a career prosecutor.”  Remember, as a career prosecutor Harris argued that you and I don’t have a right to own a handgun for personal safety, and that local governments should be able to ban you and I from legally possessing one. As a member of law enforcement, of course Harris would have been exempt from the very gun bans she wanted to keep in place in Washington, D.C., but she wanted local governments to be able to strip you of your ability to legally own a firearm for self-defense. Harris may own a gun, but that doesn’t mean she believes that you have a right to own one too.",false
c69de08e,Wisconsin Election Commission Directive Allows Clerks To ‘Fix’ Ballots [UPDATED],"This article has been updated to include more context about the directive as well as the commission’s defense of its policy.  A new report points out that an executive branch agency called the Wisconsin Election Commission issued a directive in October telling local county election clerks that they can “fix” ballots by filling in missing addresses for witnesses. According to one former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, the policy, which has been in place since October 2016, may violate a Wisconsin law requiring ballots to have a witness address to be validated. The commission has defended its policy, however, stating that the law “does not specify who affixes the address.”  Wisconsin Statute 6.87(6d) states, “If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.”  But in August, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a memo telling clerks they could fill in the address of the voter:  To make sure your ballot is counted, double check the following before you return it: Your voter information: this section is usually completed by your clerk and includes the date of the election, the county and municipality in which you are registered, your name, the address where you are registered, city, and zip code. Voter Signature: you (or your assistant) must sign in the Certification of Voter section. Witness Signature and Address: your witness must sign and provide their full address, (street number, street name, city) in the Certification of Witness section. Make sure your ballot is in your envelope and make sure the envelope is sealed properly. If any of the required information above is missing, your ballot will not be counted.  In October, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a directive to the state’s county clerks that seemed to allow them to fix incomplete (or “spoiled”) ballots missing witness signatures, writing, “Please note that the clerk should attempt to resolve any missing witness address information prior to Election Day if possible and this can be done through reliable information (personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness). The witness does not need to appear to add a missing address.”  As noted by Wisconsin Election Commission public information officer Reid Magney, the guidance has been in place since October 2016. “The guidance has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount, and no one has objected to it until now,” said Magney, as reported by USA Today.  An Oct. 18, 2016 memo from the commission reads in part (formatting adjusted):  [T]he Commission’s guidance is that municipal clerks shall do all that they can reasonably do to obtain any missing part of the witness address. Those steps may include one or more of the following options: 1. The clerk is able to reasonably discern the missing address or address component by information appearing on the envelope or from some other source, such as: The voter has provided his or her complete address and the clerk has personal knowledge that the witness resides at the same address as the voter.  The clerk has personal knowledge of the witness and knows his/or her address.  The voter’s complete address appears on the address label, and the witness indicates the same street address as the voter.  The clerk is able to utilize lists or databases at his or her disposal to determine the witness’s address. 2. The voter or witness may wish to appear in person to add the missing information, or provide the address information by phone, fax, email or mail. The voter may provide the address separately as an alternative to returning the certificate envelope and having the voter mail it back again as outlined below. 3. The voter may request that the clerk return the certificate envelope so the voter can personally add the witness address. […] 4. The voter may wish to spoil the original ballot and vote a new one.  Derek Muller, a professor of law at the Iowa School of Law, told Just The News, “This is a complication thing about elections like this. I’ve seen it in a lot of jurisdictions, what might be sort of a technical violation of the statute, in this case encouragement to county clerks about how to use their judgment on whether or not to cure a ballot.”  Retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman told WISN, “The statute is very, very clear. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, it’s not valid. That ballot is not valid.”  “In defiance of and direct contradiction to the statute, the Wisconsin Elections Commission gave guidance — that is, cover —to all 72 county clerks and turned the statute on its head,” said Gableman. “They said, ‘Gee, we know the law says an absentee ballot without the witness address is not valid, but county clerk, you have a duty to go ahead and look up on your own the witness’ address if there’s no address on the absentee ballot.’”  The Wisconsin Election Commission, however, maintains that its policies are not in violation of the law, asserting that the law “does not specify who affixes the address” and noting that the addresses have been added to the certificates rather than the ballots themselves, as AFP reports.

3c2b01de,Trump Is the Worst Kind of Socialist,"“America will never be a socialist country,” President Trump said as he launched his bid for re-election last week. That declaration was an effort to frighten Americans and undermine growing support for expanding Medicare and Social Security—two popular programs that have long been derided as “socialist.” Mr. Trump’s declaration hypocritically ignores that he and his Republican colleagues are the nation’s leading purveyors of an insidious form of corporate socialism, which uses government power and taxpayer resources to enrich Mr. Trump and his billionaire friends. When we defeat Mr. Trump in this election, we are going to end his corporate socialism and use those resources to create a 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights that benefits all people. Consider the corporate socialism we’ve seen on Wall Street, where the high priests of unfettered capitalism reign. As you will recall, Wall Street’s deification of “free markets” went out the window in 2008 as they watched the financial crisis caused by their own greed and illegal behavior threaten the existence of some of the largest financial institutions in the country. Suddenly, Wall Street became strong supporters of big-government socialism. They begged the federal government for unprecedented taxpayer assistance, and Congress provided them with the largest bailout in history. The major banks received some $700 billion from the Treasury and trillions in low-interest loans from the Federal Reserve. Meanwhile, working people all across the country lost their jobs, their homes and their life savings. The most vulnerable were hit the hardest, with the African-American community losing half its wealth. That was not an aberration. The norm across the corporate world is what the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. called “socialism for the rich, and rugged free enterprise capitalism for the poor.” If you are a fossil-fuel company, whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet, Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans offer billions in government subsidies, including special tax breaks, royalty relief and funding for research and development. But if you are struggling to pay your utility bill, you get the free market—higher and higher electric bills. If you are a pharmaceutical company, you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer-funded research. But if you are a taxpayer, you get the free market and pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs—and in some cases you die because you cannot afford the medication you need. If you are a monopoly like Amazon, owned by the wealthiest person in the U.S., you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses, yet you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes. But if you are a small business that falls behind on your store’s rent, you get the free market—which means you get an eviction notice. If you are the billionaire Walton family, state and local governments grant you free land and subsidies and build infrastructure for your stores, even as Walmart’s tax-avoidance schemes drain local towns of public revenues. But if you are a Walmart worker, you get the free market—which means starvation wages. If you are the Trump family, you got $885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family’s housing empire, which was built on racial discrimination. But if you are a homeowner struggling to pay your mortgage, you get the free market—which means foreclosure. The time is long overdue for the U.S. to end corporate socialism for Mr. Trump and the rest of the billionaire class. Instead, those resources should be put to work to ensure shared prosperity by enhancing Social Security and Medicare and investing in roads and bridges, public schools, clean water and clean air. Mr. Trump believes in corporate socialism to protect the wealth and power of the rich. I believe the U.S. must end corporate socialism and instead fulfill President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s vision of enshrining basic economic rights for all Americans. These include the rights to health care, a living wage, a decent job, a quality education, a secure retirement, affordable housing and a clean environment. We can make this 21st Century Economic Bill of Rights a reality with initiatives like Medicare for All, a $15 minimum wage, a Green New Deal, student-debt cancellation and legislation to expand Social Security. I recognize that this agenda will face enormous opposition from corporate America and the 1%. They have a vested interest in protecting the corporate socialism that has enriched and empowered them. The wealthiest three families now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country, and they will do everything they can to block our agenda. But more Americans are noticing the contradiction between coddled socialism for the rich and the destruction of opportunity for everyone else. I am confident that we will be able to build a grass-roots movement that will not only defeat Donald Trump in this election but finally create a government that works for all people, not just the billionaire class.

fb721890,"WisDems: Farmers have been crushed by Trump’s failed COVID-19 response, but he’s been dragging them down his entire presidency","(WISCONSIN) — Trump’s failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin and across the country. Farmers have been dumping milk, setting their crops on fire, and euthanizing their livestock because there is no market for their products. All the while, millions of more Americans are going hungry because they lost their jobs.  But farmers were struggling long before coronavirus hit the United States. Trump’s chaotic trade wars, particularly with China, obliterated the markets Wisconsin farmers spent decades building in just a short few months. During this time Trump and his administration told Wisconsinites the pain would be “temporary,” that farmers were “over the hump,” and that small and medium-sized family farms should just get bigger if they want to survive.  Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his reelection chances. He used their pain to push through a multi-billion dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies. After getting rolled by China on a trade deal that was a mere fraction of what he promised it would be, a recent news report confirms that Trump was never interested in bettering the lives of Wisconsin’s farmers and was simply looking out for his own political interests.  “Donald Trump crushed our farmers and the local economies they support because he only sees them as a bargaining chip, not human beings and Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman said. “Trump has been a lapdog for China as he has rolled over for them at every turn. It’s been made clear by recent news reports that Trump gambled with farmers’ livelihoods because he thought it would be good for his reelection prospects. But after decimating these communities, they’re not willing to give him another four years — they know they can’t afford it.”  Wisconsin Examiner: Farms go from frying pan of trade wars to fire of COVID-19  Coxhead said trade policies under President Donald Trump…contributed significantly to the plight of Wisconsin farmers in the last few years. The federal government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered the country’s — and Wisconsin’s — position in the world economy, he added.  Wisconsin State Farmer: Economic recovery after pandemic will be slow for farmers due to trade and internet issues  He also said the Trump administration’s volatile relationship with China, one of the country’s biggest trading partners, is a cause for concern. And a widespread lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas is causing many rural economies to fall behind entirely. “The global economic recovery, which will outpace the United States, is not really going to benefit us all that well because the administration has turned its back on international trade,” Coxhead said.  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coronavirus has hit Wisconsin dairy farms especially hard — some farmers may even have to dump milk  Coronavirus is delivering a blow to Wisconsin agriculture…export markets are threatened by global trade unrest, and some farms may not make it through the spring. “The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring…We also need to be prepared for the scenarios that would require our members to dump milk”…”or dispose of (it) in some other manner,”…the stimulus package won’t resolve long-term issues such as increased global competition and trade wars that may arise from countries closing their borders to curb the spread of COVID-19.

5a228e0e,Merck Scraps COVID Vaccines; Says It’s More Effective To Get The Virus And Recover,"Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies.  The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection.  The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482.  The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus.  “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug.  Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed.  Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days.  Meanwhile, in related news, German scientists have claimed that the UK Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less than 8% effective in over 65s, prompting the vaccine developers to hit back, rubbishing the claims.  The German media published the claims, alleging it had been ‘confirmed’ by ‘multiple’ unnamed senior German government sources.  UK government ministers have suggested that the claim could be related to the ongoing dispute over delivery of the vaccine between the European Union and AstraZeneca.  The EU, which is yet to approve the vaccine, has threatened to block exports of shots to Britain, in a move that has been branded ‘spiteful’ by British government sources.  In an effort to make sure its member states get their ‘fair share’ of vaccines, the EU has also threatened to block the delivery of Pfizer vaccines to the UK, demanding that drug companies provide detailed information on when they plan to export Covid jabs to countries outside the bloc.",partially false
3bc38092,U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin,"U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Stands Up for Wisconsin Dairy Farmers  Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act fights back against non-dairy products that are mislabeled as milk, yogurt and cheese  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin applaud the reform  WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin stood up for Wisconsin dairy farmers and introduced legislation today to combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products. The Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act (DAIRY PRIDE Act) would require non-dairy products made from nuts, seeds, plants, and algae to no longer be mislabeled with dairy terms such as milk, yogurt or cheese.  “Dairy farmers in Wisconsin work tirelessly every day to ensure that their milk meets high standards for nutritional value and quality,” said Senator Baldwin. “Imitation products have gotten away with using dairy’s good name for their own benefit, which is against the law and must be enforced. Mislabeling of plant-based products as ‘milk’ hurts our dairy farmers. That’s why I’ve authored the DAIRY PRIDE Act to take a stand for Wisconsin farmers and the quality products they make.”  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin are strongly supporting Senator Baldwin’s reform:  “Finally after all these years, it’s about time someone stands up for the American Dairy farmer. We are held to higher quality and animal care standard every year to keep milk safe. It’s not fair that the name milk should be used by non-dairy drinks to further erode what little profit we have,” said Jerry Croes, member of the Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery in Deer Park, WI.  “As a proud Wisconsin Dairy Farmer, I support Tammy Baldwin’s efforts to introduce the DAIRY PRIDE Act. I know the economic struggles we dairy farmers face on a daily basis, as I am also an Ag Lender, helping through the low milk prices of 2015 and 2016. We don’t need competition from plant-based drinks being labeled as milk and sending a false message to consumers, and also falsely advertising them as being better than cow’s milk. When compared on nutrients and price, cow’s milk still comes out on top. I am opposed to all false labeling of food products that aren’t true dairy products,” said Jim Smidel of Brothers Smidel Farms, LLP in Kewaunee, WI.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, the increasingly common practice of labeling beverages as milk when they quite obviously are not is wrong and misleading. Senator Baldwin’s bill simply asks FDA to enforce current regulations meant to uphold the standards of identity, and integrity, of milk,” said Brad Nevin, Dairy farmer and member-owner of Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) in Rice Lake, WI.  “Consumers deserve to be treated with respect and that begins with proper and accurate food labels. Milk is clearly defined by the FDA, and this definition should also be enforced. It’s about time the FDA upheld its responsibility of enforcing existing labeling requirements, especially when it comes to dairy,” said John Rettler of Tin Valley Farms in Neosho, WI.    “Dairy has built a strong reputation as a reliable source of important nutrients we need daily. To use these dairy terms on plant-based products undermines the real value that dairy provides in the form of naturally occurring Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin A among others. Consumers associate dairy with the nutrients they need, and those are naturally occurring in milk from cows,” said Janet Clark of Vision Aire Farms in Eldorado, WI.  “Thank you, Senator Baldwin, for taking the initiative to protect the definition of milk, cheese and yogurt. Your advocacy supports the hard and honest work of dairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the nation, and more importantly, supports clear and accurate information to be shared on food labels, something consumers deserve,” said David Cooper, General Manager of FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison, WI.  “The FDA has already clearly defined milk, and liquid from a plant does not fit this definition. Existing regulation should be enforced, reserving the use of the term ‘milk’ exclusively for those products that deliver the nutritional value only found in dairy. We thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership on this matter,” said Mark Frederixon, Blair Division Manager of Associated Milk Producers Inc. (AMPI) in Blair, WI.  Dairy producer coalitions and groups around the country are also applauding the legislation:  “For too long, the FDA has turned a blind eye to the misbranding of imitation dairy products, despite the decades-old federal law that milk comes from animals, not vegetables or nuts. None of these imitators provides the same high quality and quantity of nutrition offered by real milk. Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act will simply ensure that FDA enforces current law by requiring marketers of these imitation products to call them something other than milk,” said Jim Mulhern, President and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation.  “Dairy farmers invest a great deal of time and money to produce a wholesome, nutritious product for consumers, and take pride in the milk they produce. The federal government has promised to ensure that the term “milk” on store shelves can only be used on dairy products. But they have fallen short on that promise. The bill introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin will help ensure that products labeled as milk are indeed dairy products. Consumers and dairy farmers alike will be the beneficiaries of this effort,” said Steve Etka of the Midwest Dairy Coalition.  ""The Wisconsin Dairy Products Association. which represents processors that manufacture a wide range of dairy products, supports Senator Baldwin’s legislation which protects the integrity and image of wholesome and nutritious dairy products,"" said Bradley Legreid, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Dairy Products Association.  ""Wisconsin Farmers Union fully supports the introduction and swift passage of the DAIRY PRIDE Act. Our grassroots, member-driven policy opposes any changes in the FDA definition of milk, cheese or other products made with milk and opposes the use of the word ""milk"" to designate any product not derived from mammals,"" Darin Von Ruden, President of the Wisconsin Farmers Union.  “National Farmers Union supports policy that encourages the healthy consumption of real dairy products and prevents the mislabeling of imitation and substitute dairy products in the marketplace. We appreciate Senator Baldwin’s leadership on the DAIRY PRIDE Act and her commitment to our nation’s dairy producers,” said Roger Johnson, President of the National Farmers Union.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, dairy imitators do not naturally provide the same level of nutrition as milk does,” said Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “We look forward to working with Senator Baldwin on this important legislation.”  “Cooperative Network strongly supports efforts to protect the integrity of dairy products by requiring national enforcement of the sensible labeling requirements we already have on the books. When misbranded items are corrected, we believe consumers will choose real dairy products over imitations, which will benefit Wisconsin’s vital $43 billion dollar dairy industry,” said Tom Liebe, President and CEO of the Cooperative Network.  “We applaud the efforts of Senator Baldwin to ensure that non-dairy foods are not inaccurately labeled as milk, cheese or yogurt. Our dairy farmers and processors work hard to produce incredible food. Milk and other real dairy products offer an almost unbeatable level and variety of nutrition. Mislabeling non-dairy foods confuses people buying these products and misleads them about the nutritional value of the items they purchase. It also hurts dairy farmers and related businesses. This bill is simply asking the FDA to adequately enforce the laws already on the books. It’s a small step that could have a very big positive impact,” said John Holevoet, Director of Government Affairs, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act is also supported by Bongards Creameries, Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery, First District Association, Dairy Business Association, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative, FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative, Mid-west Dairymen's Company and Scenic Central Milk Producers.  Current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals. Although existing federal regulation are clear, the FDA has not enforced these labeling regulations and the mislabeling of products as ‘milk’, ‘yogurt’ and ‘cheese’ has increased rapidly. This hurts dairy farmers that work tirelessly to ensure their Made in Wisconsin dairy products meet FDA standards and provide the public with nutritious food. It has also led to the proliferation of mislabeled alternative products that contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act would require the FDA to issue guidance for nationwide enforcement of mislabeled imitation dairy products within 90 days and require the FDA to report to Congress two years after enactment to hold the agency accountable for this update in their enforcement obligations.

673f05fa,Danny O'Connor has more than 10 times Troy Balderson's money going into November rematch,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - After narrowly winning an Aug. 7 special election for a Columbus-area congressional seat, newly minted GOP Rep. Troy Balderson of Zanesville is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor, Federal Election Commission filings show.  Reports that covered the pair's campaign fundraising from July 19 through Aug. 27 showed O'Connor had more than $1 million in the bank at the end of August, compared with under $93,000 for Balderson.  O'Connor took in almost $4 million during the period covered by the report, including more than $1.4 million he got after losing the election by 1,680 votes. Balderson raised slightly more than $500,000. Roughly $180,000 of the cash Balderson raised came from political action committees.  O'Connor's campaign said he got donations from more than 92,000 people in the period covered by the report, most of whom gave small amounts of money. Most donors listed in his report were from outside of Ohio.  ""We have thousands of people chipping in $5 and $10 at a time,"" said O'Connor's campaign manager Annie  Ellison  . ""They are excited about Danny's campaign for new leadership. And we are really proud of that.""  Balderson's campaign had a different take on O'Connor's haul.  ""Liberal out of state special interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O'Connor's campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker's chair,"" said a statement Balderson released through his campaign before his own report was filed. ""While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90% of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values.""  O'Connor's campaign got more than $114,000 from political action committees, including $5,000 each from organizations associated with autoworkers, boilermakers and firefighters unions. He also got a $5,000 donation from a committee associated with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and $2,000 from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign committee.  The political committees that contributed to Balderson included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which gave $2,000, and political committees associated with aspiring House of Representatives speakers Kevin McCarthy of California, who gave $4,000, and Jim Jordan of Champaign County, who gave $2,000. Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's political committee gave $5,000 to Balderson, as did political action committees for Koch Industries, Murray Energy, and Cardinal Health.  O'Connor's campaign said Balderson's report demonstrated he's ""beholden"" to corporations and party bosses.  ""We're proud of the grassroots support behind Danny's campaign for new leadership because people are ready for someone who isn't beholden to any corporation or party boss, that's why he didn't take a single dime of corporate PAC money and 92% of contributions were for $50 or less,"" Ellison said. ""Central Ohioans get excited for new leadership when they hear from Danny, and with this grassroots army we'll have the resources to communicate his message.""  O'Connor's biggest expenses were more than $2.6.million spent on media production and buys, and digital services. He felt financially secure enough to give a $25,000 contribution to the Ohio Democratic Party on Aug. 10.  Balderson's campaign spent more than $400,000 on media buys and more than $42,000 on fundraising services. He also paid the Republican National Committee $25,000 for a campaign event.  Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that outside groups spent more than $5 million so far to back Balderson and oppose O'Connor, while groups sympathetic to O'Connor have spent around $1.3 million.  ""My record of balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and delivering results are what Ohioans are looking for in a Congressman, as evidenced by my victory in the August special election,"" said a statement from Balderson. ""We will have the necessary resources to deliver that message and defend against any attacks from the O'Connor-Pelosi team.""",partially false
e2e93a55,Pro-Life Groups Upset UN Coronavirus Relief Funds Can Promote Abortions in Ecuador,"The United Nations is using coronavirus aid to fund abortions in Ecuador, pro-life leaders in the country claim.  The Catholic News Agency reports the country’s Ministry of Foreign Relations and Human Mobility recently asked for $46.4 million in aid from the UN Humanitarian Response Plan COVID-19.  Within that UN funding package, however, is a goal to “maintain continuity of maternal, neonatal and children’s health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic,” including abortions, according to the report.  “[Our] fear is that our highest authority in Ecuador will even consider accepting this economic shakedown of $46 million in exchange for the lives of thousands of unborn children,” Martha Villafuerte of the pro-life Guayaquil Family Network told ACI Prensa.  The Guayaquil Family Network and other pro-life organizations recently began a petition urging President Lenin Moreno to reject the abortion agenda within the aid, according to the report.  “It goes against the Constitution, specifically article 45, which guarantees the right to life from conception, a right that was ratified last September 17 at the plenary session of the National Assembly,” Villafuerte said.  HELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation!  Villafuerte said the UN plan would give Ecuador $46.4 million, but $3 million of that aid would be used to train “health personnel on safe, legal abortion and post-abortion care.”  Some lawmakers are speaking out against the abortion agenda, too.  “Unbelievable! The UN conditions ‘safe legal abortion’ in its humanitarian support plan for Ecuador,” Assemblyman Héctor Yépez wrote on Twitter. “While we all want to save lives, some insist on eliminating the lives of unborn girls and boys.”  UPDATE 5/26/20: The Ecuadorian government has assured Yépez that funds would not be used to legalize abortions and would only be spent in accordance with current laws.  In statements to ACI Prensa, legislator Yépez referred to the Foreign Ministry’s response. “The objective of preventing them from executing what the UN wanted, which was an attempt to advance abortion, was achieved, but now they come out with a pun to wash their faces, in which they say that they were only referring to what it was already established in the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code ”. “I think the objective has been met, having discovered the intent, and with this letter they themselves are ensuring that they are not going to execute anything outside of what the law says in Ecuador, which is what we were looking for,” he stressed. However, Yépez urged “to remain very vigilant so that the COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Plan is not distorted.”  The United Nations has faced prior international criticism for pushing abortions as part of its response to the coronavirus.  Jonathan Abbamonte of the Population Research Institute wrote more about it earlier this month:  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has also been urging governments to ensure uninterrupted access to abortion during the pandemic. An interim technical brief recently issued by UNFPA calls on governments to: “Ensure women’s and girls’ choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health is respected regardless of their COVID-19 status, including access to contraception, emergency contraception, safe abortion to the full extent of the law.” The technical brief also advises governments to “encourage” women who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection to seek abortion services “to the full extent of the law.” This seems a backhanded way of saying that, when women come to African health clinics to be treated for the coronavirus, they should also be propagandized about the benefits of abortion. Health care in Africa has often been directly tied to population control programs in this way.  The WHO also faced heavy criticism from pro-life leaders this spring when it falsely claimed abortion is an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic.  President Donald Trump stopped giving United States tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund in 2017, and, in April, he halted funding to the World Health Organization (WHO).

ae596f59,CBC Cuts Donald Trump's 'Home Alone 2' Cameo Out of Broadcast,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is full of violence that, in my opinion, exceeds the physical comedy of the original film and is borderline barbarism. The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That’s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump’s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.  You guys are the biggest bush league “journalists” of all time. Editing out Trump’s cameo in Home Alone 2. What kind of state-sponsored bullshit it that? #Defund — James (@Jameseast_) December 23, 2019  https://twitter.com/TEKO8827/status/1209962103295086592  @CBC Cutting Trump from Home Alone 2 is disgusting & your pathetic — Wrestling Fan Forever (@617WrestlingFan) December 25, 2019  https://twitter.com/ADiMarco25/status/1206364668576579586  According to the CBC, the movie “was edited to allow for commercial time within the format.”  Here’s where that explanation fails to pass the smell test:  Donald Trump formally announced his campaign in June 2015. The first time the CBC’s cutting of Trump’s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. — Colt McCaullany🇨🇦 (@DENNISGRIMBLE) December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn’t a political figure in the public’s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama’s birth certificate—so I don’t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I’m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump’s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can’t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama’s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

610801c6,New research of toxic bait might provide control of wild hog problem in Texas and other states,"The rapid and uncontrolled population growth of feral swine in Texas and other affected states has been a severe problem for at least the last decade, damages caused by the wild animals reaching into the millions just in Texas.  Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture (crops and livestock), native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a ""hog-apocalypse"" involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit (EUP) from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  ""Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners,"" reports APHIS Wildlife Services (WS) Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. ""With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.""  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders (herds) each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders’ territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state’s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  ""Sodium nitrite (NaNO2) is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose,"" Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  ""Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth,"" Clay said. ""Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.""  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are ""very intelligent creatures,"" and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  ""We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, ""Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  ""We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats,"" Ortiz notes.",partially false

Watch below (timestamp 2:35) –  Partial transcript:  “…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people. Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly.  “Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that.  “So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”",false

Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot.  Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign will continue to bring these allegations to light, and the media and election authorities should vigorously examine them.  Here are several examples in Georgia that should be investigated:  Voter records show someone used the identity of Mrs. Deborah Jean Christiansen of Roswell, Georgia to vote in the recent election, even though Mrs. Christiansen passed away in May 2019. Further, someone registered Christiansen to vote on October 5, the day of the deadline to register, more than a year after she passed away. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran an obituary announcing Christiansen’s death at the time of her passing.  Someone used the identity of James Blalock of Covington, Georgia to cast a ballot in last week’s election, even though Blalock died in 2006. Blalock’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution shortly after he passed away that year.  Linda Kesler of Nicholson, Georgia died in 2003, but someone cast a ballot under her identity in last week’s election. Nicholson’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution when she passed away.  Edward Skwiot of Trenton, Georgia is shown as having cast a ballot last week, even though he died in 2015. The Chattanooga Times Free Press ran a death notice in April of that year.

a14a969b,Cynthia Nixon slams Cuomo on Albany's culture of corruption,"ALBANY – Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon said the state’s economic development programs overseen by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo need an overhaul, which she said will become especially evident this summer during the corruption trial into the awarding of the Buffalo Billion and other upstate projects. “I think it’s going to be incredibly damaging"" for Cuomo, Nixon said in an interview with The Buffalo News about the political impact of the pay-to-play trial of several Buffalo and Syracuse executives and the recent conviction of a former trusted adviser of Cuomo. “In the corruption Olympics that is Albany, I think Andrew Cuomo is winning himself some gold medals,"" said the actress and political activist who on Monday announced her Democratic primary run against Cuomo. In a 16-minute interview, her first with a daily news outlet since her campaign started, Nixon kept up her barrage of assaults on Cuomo and sought to lay out a path for her candidacy. Though focused in the early days on New York City, Nixon said she expects to begin an upstate campaign either next week or the following week. Nixon, 51, best known as one of the stars of the ""Sex and the City"" television series and movies, is making her first run for elected office. She said one of the reasons she is running is “because of Andrew Cuomo’s enormous tax breaks” that she said have benefited wealthy people and corporations. Asked for her view of a major tax break Cuomo has championed for the film and television industry, Nixon said she is studying the issue. But, she quickly added, “I don’t think there’s any real truth that that enormous expenditure of money is making a significant enough different in production to justify it.’’ She added that the more than $420 million annual tax break the industry receives “doesn’t merit the investment” the state is giving in tax credits. She said the beneficiaries are predominately large entertainment companies. Nixon, who has been involved in public school funding activism for 16 years, slammed Cuomo for not providing enough state aid to the Buffalo city schools. She estimated Buffalo schools would be owed more than $100 million in aid from the state, had Albany followed the decision that came out of a landmark school funding lawsuit won by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, a group Nixon got involved with when her oldest teenager began as a kindergarten student in a New York City public school. Actress and activist Cynthia Nixon launches run against Cuomo But Nixon saved much of her attacks on Cuomo over the component of the Buffalo Billion program that is going to be front and center in a federal courtroom later this summer. “If you look at (Cuomo’s) attempt at economic development, there’s just been enormous giveaways with not a lot to show for it. Buffalo Billion is a prime example of the intersection of corruption and pay to play, giving state business to his donors without a lot of oversight, without a lot of strings attached,"" Nixon said. “The thing that’s so awful about the Buffalo Billion is the corruption, of course … but also how much money is being spent with so little accountability. The corruption is one thing, but these are just a bad investment of taxpayer dollars,"" she said. Nixon added that “it was good that jobs were created” in the broader Buffalo Billion program, but she questioned the way in which economic development dollars are dedicated by the Cuomo administration and said more state money needs to be spent on crumbling infrastructure needs. “We need an overall, real investment in our infrastructure,"" she said. The looming Buffalo Billion trial in June is partly over alleged pay-to-play bribery allegations involving the state’s more than $750 million contract to build the solar manufacturing plant at Buffalo’s RiverBend. Cuomo has not been accused of any criminal wrongdoing by federal prosecutors.",true

The Senate Republicans’ plan includes proposals that prioritize restarting our local economies, rethinking how New York State operates, and renewing a commitment to New York State’s residents to ensure strong, robust communities.  Restart our Local Economies by:  · Safely reopening our small businesses to help them get back on their feet and offer gainful employment for residents;  · Helping our schools and colleges stay open; and  · Investing in our physical and human infrastructure to rebuild our state’s competitiveness.  Rethink how New York State Operates by:  · Ending New York State’s unaffordability problem, which has been made worse by the pandemic;  · Taking on State government’s culture of overspending and restoring fiscal responsibility; and  · Reasserting the Legislature’s constitutional authority as an equal branch of government.  Renew our Commitment to Residents by:  · Fostering the growth of vibrant local communities;  · Developing a robust economy with diverse opportunities; and  · Creating safer neighborhoods with common sense public safety measures.  “New York government is failing its people. Broken policies have made New York more expensive, less safe and have diminished the quality of life for our residents. We need to change course before it is too late,” said Deputy Leader Andrew Lanza.  “Throughout this pandemic, there seems to have been little interest from New York’s one-party leadership in stepping up and taking an active legislative role in constructively combating the pandemic by putting our communities’ safety and livelihoods at the forefront of legislative policy. I’m proud to join my colleagues in offering actual solutions to help us rise to meet the challenges ahead. I call on my colleagues across the political spectrum to join us as we work toward ending this terrible crisis and rebuilding our state for the better,” said Senator Fred Akshar.  “While New York State once stood tall in our nation as a pillar of economic strength, educational excellence and public policy innovation, its leadership today is more dubious. High taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate have made us number one in population loss, and a misguided focus on politically driven agendas has diverted precious resources away from our core responsibilities. With the added challenges created by the pandemic, the future of our state hangs in the balance. If there was ever a compelling case to rethink and change course, this is it,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Long before the COVID-19 pandemic turned our world upside down, New York faced daunting challenges, including a looming budget deficit and a shrinking population. The corona virus has exacerbated our problems, adding to the financial burden we face and bringing our economy and many small businesses to the brink. As we fight the pandemic, we must also safely re-open our economy, control spending, ease the burden on taxpayers and restore our system of checks and balances in state government,” said Senator Patrick M. Gallivan.  “We have seen an exodus of New York residents, families and businesses who have fled the state for better opportunities elsewhere because of unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes. Substantive and dramatic change is needed, especially at a time when the state’s fiscal challenges have been significantly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. This plan refocuses the state’s priorities and helps to build a better and brighter future for New York,” said Senator Joseph Griffo.  “Together we can restore New York to its rightful status as the Empire State. To accomplish this we must work with our small business owners, farmers and other job creators. My focus is on getting New York open for business and helping people get back to work safely. This common sense package would help the communities I represent and put our state on the road to real economic recovery and future prosperity,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “Overcoming the unprecedented, ongoing health, economic, and community challenges posed by COVID-19 requires big, bold solutions. We need to rethink the state’s approach to solving problems, successfully restart our economy, and renew our commitment to residents and each other. Partisan politics and a bureaucratic Albany trapped in the old ways of doing things won’t work. What will work is advancing smarter public policies that recognize the breadth and depth of our challenges and the necessity of fresh thinking that goes beyond party labels. It’s time for our state to hit the reset button, and it begins with the priorities and principles we are unveiling today. Our Reset New York State plan reflects our continued efforts to bring New Yorkers together and improve the quality of life across our state. We are ready to answer the challenges of COVID and deliver the positive change New Yorkers expect and rightfully deserve,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “Between July 2019 and July 2020, New York State led the nation in at least one thing- people moving out. The pandemic only accelerated a trend that was already in place. High taxes and an unfriendly business climate are the real culprits. Our small businesses need help and our state needs a new direction. We already know what works from other states that are growing and not shrinking. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, instead we need a reset. Senate Republicans have a plan to do just that and I'm proud to support it,” said Senator Michael Martucci.  “As our state begins to emerge from the current crisis, it is vital that we start immediately working together to make our state’s future brighter than the past. The ‘Reset New York’ plan reflects the priorities of hardworking New Yorkers and I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference to make sure their voices are heard in Albany. The challenges our state faces are not new but the solutions must be – and finding them must be our main focus,” said Senator Mario Mattera.  “I look forward throughout this new legislative session to our Senate Republican Conference giving voice to the need for rebuilding local economies, focusing on stronger and safer communities, and resisting what threatens to be a devastating expansion of a business-as-usual, tax-and-spend direction in state government. This ‘Reset New York’ strategy begins our commitment to more fiscally responsible, commonsense government that works better for taxpayers, builds and protects livelihoods, honors public safety and security, and focuses like never before on the restoration of Upstate’s rightful place in New York government,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “New York is facing true challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is one reason for our struggles, but wayward state policies that fail to meet the needs of our small businesses, families, and taxpayers, are the real culprit. There is no margin for error and the time is now to change course by enacting the Reset New York agenda. Specifically, broadband access, support for our farmers, and a strong educational system are among the initial building blocks that can set us on the right path. Let’s enact policies that create opportunities, not those that confine us,” said Senator Peter Oberacker.  “Long Island’s families, businesses and seniors are hurting and need greater support and relief from state government, both in the immediate term to help get through the pandemic and in the future to ensure that New York is a more affordable and safer place to call home. Reset New York will put us on a trajectory to accomplish these goals and begin to reverse the trends of higher taxes, burdensome regulations, and more crime that has caused hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the Empire State,” said Senator Anthony Palumbo.  “New York is in desperate need of a reset. The pandemic has highlighted and exasperated the issues that our state has faced for decades. We continue to lose residents and jobs, with our high taxes and over regulations. Our communities are suffering. Small businesses, restaurants and family farms are struggling to stay afloat. We need to provide real answers and solutions to help our local economies and save our struggling communities. We can no longer ignore these glaring issues. New Yorkers need results now,” said Senator Ed Rath.  “In recent years, people have been fleeing New York State due to high taxes, a lack of opportunity, and red tape that hinders business growth. The pandemic has only made matters worse and now, more than ever, our state needs a reset. From reenergizing our small businesses to making New York more affordable for hardworking taxpayers, my colleagues and I are committed to fighting for changes that will improve our state in the wake of this unprecedented pandemic,” said Senator Patty Ritchie.  “Despite the unprecedented challenges that our communities are facing, New Yorkers have remained resilient, and now more than ever, they need a government determined to deliver results. If we want to rebuild our state, we have to start by resetting the state's priorities and ensuring that the needs of hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers are firmly at the top. I am proud to join with my colleagues to reaffirm our commitment to that goal and to do all that we can to ensure that small businesses, middle class families, and struggling New Yorkers have a strong, independent voice on their side,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “There’s only one way forward and that’s to enable our businesses and communities, big and small, to have the best possible chance to recover. When the need for help is apparent, too often the response of government is to throw an anvil instead of a life-preserver into the water. We can’t make this harder with higher taxes and more unreasonable demands. Our vision must show that we are listening. That’s what this is about,” said Senator Dan Stec.  “As we begin a New Year and new legislative session, our top priority must continue to be addressing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so we can stop the spread of the virus, save lives and safely reopen our economy. In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade. When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities? I look forward to joining with Leader Ortt and my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference in the coming weeks and months to address these issues and put forth policies to turn things around so the Empire State does not become the ‘Empty State,’” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “I look forward to joining my Senate Republican Conference colleagues in advancing our ambitious Reset New York plan today. As we all work toward opening our State and local communities safely from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus must be on the economy, which starts with advancing policies that support small businesses, which are the backbones of our communities, jobs, public safety, improving our local infrastructure, and ensuring our schools get their fair share. One party control has pushed those priorities to the side and with our Reset New York plan, our Conference will ensure that the voices of our constituents are heard,” said Senator Alexis Weik.  ###",partially false
c3dea290,BREAKING: US Military at the White House Arresting Congress,"Special Operations (SOF) units including 4,000 deputized National Guard soldiers acting as US Marshalls, have served indictments on, or were about to arrest 67% of Congress. Early Mon. morning 25 Jan.  between 3 and 6 am Military vans, buses and police cars, along with a multitude of police and Military troops, were very busy at a blacked out White House.  “I just watched everyone in the White House arrested” declared an unnamed person doing one of the two videos shown below. (Video contains graphic language) https://youtu.be/ywfXNGNvvuU      Even though the Mass Media have refused to report it, the US has been functioning under Martial Law since Sat. 9 Jan. An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent. A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military.  Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat.  Mustang Medic’s recording showed many buses and vans, some marked as Military, entering the Capitol grounds. Several people were taped getting out of their cars, showing IDs to guards and then walking into the grounds.      https://rumble.com/vdawtd-mass-arrest-at-the-capitol.html  When it was over and seemingly on Q, fireworks lit up the sky. Reports from those on the ground claimed that by later that day the White House was closed up tight and remained so as of right now.  https://youtu.be/iqjVRcSejWU  Evidently Biden’s team was not in the White House, but detained and arrested behind the scenes. The US Military was expected to have arrested Harris on charges of treason, while invoking the 25th Amendment on Biden because of his dementia and subsequent inability to hold office. (The Deep State had plans to invoke the 25th on Biden, put Harris in his place and Pelosi as VP. Not going to happen).  On Fri. 22 Jan. a Juan O Savin reported that the US Interim Military Government was about to arrest Joe Biden and his traitor Deep State politicians in DC. Crimes of these elite politicians have recently been exposed from findings of the Russia hoax Mueller probe, impeachments of Trump and Obamagate.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT57EP1wL9g&feature=share      It was reported that to date, 260 global elites have been served, “The deal that they got was that if they gave information that was useful, they could have a better death, or a jail cell for life.

Communications would be cut off for a short period of time. There’s some mayors, governors and judges out there with their names on some of the over 222, 286 sealed indictments filed in federal courts across the nation since Trump took office in 2016.  On Tues. 26 Jan from about 11am EST to about 4pm EST there were massive internet and network outages on the East Coast said to be a cover for Special Operations (SOF) units making arrests of Deep State bad guys.  https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/26/tech/verizon-fios-outage/index.html  Soon the Emergency Broadcast System would be activated to announce all. The Military would then produce all TV programming for at least the next 72 hours, filled with videos of political elite’s tribunals, accompanied by seven messages from Trump. The networks have already been informed that they could be criminally liable if they didn’t allow the feed to air.  With global financial markets imploding, on Wed. 27 Jan. the worldwide Global Currency Reset was set to take place. Sun. 31 Jan. was Freedom Day as per Trump’s Executive Order signed on July 4 2020.  Last Thurs. 21 Jan. two Baghdad suicide bombers killed 32 and seriously injured dozens of others. That was reported to be Deep State Iranian/ISIS retaliation for the GCR being pushed out in Iraq and globally.  https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suicide-attack-kills-3-injures-16-in-central-baghdad-market-police-101611216986846.html  Since Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html  The ten miles of Washington DC, White House and the Capitol Building was secured with barbed wire fences and over 30,000 troops. The US Military would control all assets, taxpayer dollars, conduct a return to a gold/asset-backed dollar and insure the Republic would be restored to elements of the original Constitution as written prior to 1871.

3b246b55,This New Bill Would Allow Texas Teachers To Kill Their Students If They Felt It Was Needed,"Texas state Rep. Dan Flynn(R) has proposed a bill called the Teacher’s Protection Act (H.B.868). It would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, a school bus, or at an event sponsored by a school either in self-defense or defense of students at the school. Teachers would also be allowed to use guns while defending school property. In addition, teachers who shot someone under such circumstances would be granted “civil immunity,” which means they could not be held liable if the student they shot was injured or killed. Teachers in Texas already have the right to keep guns in the classroom.  Flynn is a strong supporter of gun rights. He has worked on pieces of legislation that permitted people to have guns on college campuses and that reduced the required minimum number of hours of training for a concealed handgun license.  Gun advocates have been demanding that teachers be armed ever since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 that resulted in 20 fatalities. Gun control advocates, however, state that easy access to guns increases crime. Psychologists also note that easy access to guns increases the chance of somebody getting shot during an emotionally charged confrontation.  Civil rights organizations also oppose the bill. They point out that black and Latino students are already more likely to be disciplined harshly at school than are their white classmates. They are more likely to be suspended or expelled. Civil rights activists worry that since students of color are already being targeted for their behavior by school authorities, they would be more likely to be the victims of gun-wielding teachers than their white peers.

da01ca66,Current Actual Election Result Update: President Trump Leading In Electoral College With More Paths to Victory Than Biden,"Based on actual results and accounting for states currently not called, still counting, recounting, under investigation or audit, or states with election issues now in the courts, President Trump is winning the 2020 Presidential Election.  Per consideration for all the states still in question, President Trump is currently winning the 2020 election.  Here is what we already know. A number of states have been called but a number are still in question. Here is a list of those in question.  Pennsylvania – although the current counts show Biden leading there is so much corruption in this state that it is likely that this state will never come to a transparent and agreed upon decision on who wins this state. President Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden. The President has a clear path to victory once the illegal votes are addressed.  TRENDING: FBI Sends Out Warning Advising Against Buying, Making or Misrepresenting a Vaccine Card Which May Be ""Breaking the Law""  Wisconsin – this state as well now shows Biden in the lead but early in the morning after the election more than 100,000 votes magically appeared in Milwaukee. The current lead for Biden is only 20,000. If these votes or the exception in the numbers in Rock County are addressed, Trump will likely win this state by a large margin.  Michigan – this state is as well full of fraud. Lawsuits are in place. In addition there were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well.  Georgia – this state too has much fraud. The President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots. Now Biden leads in this state as well. Once the harvested ballots are thrown out, this state will go to Trump as well.  Nevada – there is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here as well.

Alaska – this still hasn’t been called but it is clearly a red state and should have been called on Election night. No doubt more monkey business going on here as well.  In spite of all the fraud, the President currently has more roads to win the election than Biden:  If Americans and President Trump obtain fair verdicts in court decisions, President Trump will be declared the winner.

465eaa43,4 challenges await Panetta at DOD,"One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword, says the author. | AP photo 4 challenges await Panetta at DOD  Defense Secretary-designate Leon Panetta gained vast government experience as a reform-minded member of the House, where he chaired the Budget Committee. He later served in the White House as President Bill Clinton’s director of the Office of Management and Budget and then chief of staff. He aimed to put America’s financial accounts on a path to balance by the year 2000. He succeeded.  His integrity, lawyerly leadership, razor-sharp mind and affable demeanor will serve our nation, President Barack Obama and the Defense Department well.  Four major challenges await him at DoD:  • Address the wear and tear protracted warfare has exacted on our armed forces  The longest military engagements in U.S. history have achieved exemplary results at significant human cost. Multiple deployments, 5,885 deaths, thousands of permanent disabilities, inadequate dwell time, broken families, historic levels of suicide by soldiers and even family members and more than $2 trillion in treasure — all demand that our nation set firm timetables to complete the military mission and turn operations over to civilian control.  U.S. soldiers should not be expected to do nation-building. Ensuring success halfway around the world requires robust engagement of the world community — starting with neighboring nations whose backyards adjoin the undemocratic societies in which our soldiers bear the burden of order.  One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword. People in those societies should aspire to a better future for themselves — and be willing to sacrifice for it.  • Balance security concerns with budget realities    The need to cut war-induced federal deficits, both in the short term and long term, means that all spending must be on the table — including defense. It now makes up 20 percent of annual federal spending. Military leaders under Panetta must be resourceful, efficient and visionary to save dollars, while keeping our commitment to the troops and without compromising our national security.  The killing of Osama bin Laden is likely to further disrupt the capacity of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, allowing the U.S. to continue to withdraw forces from Iraq and begin an orderly drawdown from Afghanistan. Even so, the U.S. must maintain, as the Obama administration has pledged, a strong and agile military that is well trained and well equipped.  The new secretary recognizes the importance of hard power and soft power and understands that America must not only be militarily strong, but financially sound.  • Reining in the contractors    The increase in the use of contractors demands special scrutiny at the highest levels for three reasons:  a. Morale in the ranks  Insourcing military functions back to DoD is necessary — not just for prudent management of taxpayer dollars but morale in the ranks. When an E5 guard pilot, who enlisted at basic pay, sees contractors earning five times as much and operating by different rules of the road, there is a serious breakdown in the value set of service. Indeed the very meaning of military service changes from “duty” to “job.” Long term, this will corrupt the military code of honor and needs to be reined in now.  b. Security  Significant outsourcing of Pentagon duties to contractors increases the likelihood of security breaches. The military is aware this has even occurred in theater.  I can recall my shock at seeing signs posted in Iraq’s Green Zone: “No Alcohol on Base.” These were meant to curb contractor abuse. But what a poor message this sends to our regular forces. Military service should be exactly that – service to our nation, not one’s wallet.  c. Cost savings  Defense Secretary Robert Gates has left a goal of reducing service-support contractors by 10 percent each year for three years. Yet the FY 2012 budget seems to contradict this goal — since it contains funding to support growing contracted services. DoD proposes spending at least $87.6 billion next year on contracted services — $23.7 billion more than requested in FY 2011 and a 38 percent increase!  This increase in contractor spending flies in the face of a congressionally mandated inventory of contractors that the department has been derelict in providing. Hopefully, this is a lapse that Panetta can rectify early in his tenure.  Regaining U.S. energy independence  The Pentagon, as the largest petroleum user in the world, must lead our nation forward to energy independence. No challenge could be more vital to national security and economic security interests. High fuel costs are causing a hardship on American families, to be sure — but also on our service branches.  Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400.  The Marines, the Navy and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus have been pacesetters among the service branches in developing alternatives to petroleum. Mabus told our subcommittee earlier this year, “Energy consumption in the Navy and Marine Corps has become a strategic vulnerability, an operational Achilles’ heel and a readiness challenge.”  The Navy and Marine Corps have set the goal to generate at least 50 percent of all the energy they use come from alternative sources no later than 2020. This is leadership. Panetta would be well served to expand this vision department-wide. Regaining U.S. energy independence is the national security issue of our time.  I look forward to working with Mr. Panetta and our subcommittee as we work together to put the Defense Department on a sustainable path to meet our nation’s vital needs in the 21st century.  Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) is on the Budget and Defense subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee.",true
8cf3a230,Rep. David McKinley Calls for Increase in Border Patrol Agent Ranks,"WHEELING — At least $53 million a week in illegal drugs cross the Mexican border into the U.S. each week, and more border agents are needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to stop this, according to U.S. Rep. David B. McKinley.  McKinley, R-W.Va., recently traveled to the U.S.-Mexican border to learn about the issue there first hand. He visited the McAllen, Texas region in the Rio Grande District of the U.S. Border Patrol.  He commended the work of the border agents.  “They put themselves in danger and try to keep the border clean and secure. They’ve done that for decades,” McKinley said. “What has compounded this is the humanitarian crisis. We didn’t always have so many people trying to cross illegally.”  The agents attempt to still do their security job, put many are being pulled off the line to take care of the humanitarian crisis.  While at the border, McKinley learned a Mexican drug cartel controls happenings at the border.  He spoke with immigrants detained at the border who told him they paid the cartel anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 to get them across the border. Often, part of the deal is that the immigrant carry illegal drugs with them on the journey.  If the immigrants are captured, they are sent back to their village and must start over again and seek help from the cartel, McKinley said.  “One of the border officers said they (the cartel) might be making as much money on this as they are on drugs,” he said.  Border guards have a lot of tools to help track immigrants crossing into the U.S., even if they don’t have the manpower to stop all of them, according to McKinley.  The entire U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long, while the Rio Grande District agents focus on a specific 300-mile area. Sections of the Rio Grande River are narrow, and often the water is so low immigrants can walk across it. Border guards showed McKinley the footsteps in the mud where some had walked across the night before.  Where there isn’t a wall, cameras and sensors are placed to indicate when an immigrant is coming across the border.  But the cartel knows when agents could be as far as 10 miles away from a possible passage and unable to stop it. That’s when they help immigrants cross into the U.S., according to McKinley.  Nearly a million immigrants were stopped at the border before entering the U.S. last year, he said. Rio Grande District agents were responsible for 399,000 of the arrests, but they know from their technology they missed at least 47,000 immigrants in their crossing.  Many of these immigrants entering the U.S. carried opioids, according to McKinley.  “(Border agents) say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,” he said.  To compare, the state of West Virginia recently received $28 million for opioid rehabilitation, treatment and education.  “Almost twice that amount comes across the border each week — to put it into perspective,” McKinley said.",true

31a6122b,"Gas prices have dropped, but in N.Y. state they're still pretty high","BUFFALO, N.Y. (WKBW) — As people stay home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, the price of gas has slowly started to drop.  But in New York State, that’s not saying much.  That’s because New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, according to numbers provided by the AAA of Western and Central New York.  Nationally, the average price of a gallon of gas is $1.77, compared to $2.89 a year ago.  In New York State, it's $2.18 per gallon, compared to $2.96 a year ago.  In Buffalo, gas is now $2.23 per gallon, compared to $2.88 a year ago.  “The oil prices have a direct impact on what we pay at the pump, so with these low oil prices and this low demand for gasoline right now, we're just seeing gas prices drop,” said Elizabeth Carey, spokeswoman for the AAA.  Oil demand first started to drop in China, she said, and government directives for the coronavirus now have people stuck at home here.  “Gas has been coming down for nine straight weeks since this all began,” Carey said of the outbreak and traveling restrictions.  But some motorists wonder why Western New Yorkers are not seeing more of a break here in local gas prices.  One 7 Eyewitness News viewer wrote, ""The gas stations will up their prices the second gas goes up even though the gas in the tanks was purchased at a lower market value. Are we paying over a dollar in taxes in NYS or are they gouging?""  Another wrote, ""Why is gas on the reservation 97 cents? Add 46 cents taxes [and] why are we not paying $1.43 a [gallon] on regular gas stations? We [are] getting ripped off.""  “You have to consider the New York State taxes,” Carey said.  That's right: she said higher gas prices are just a reality for motorists living in the Empire State. New Yorkers pay $0.65 in taxes for every gallon of gas they buy, and more than $0.45 are state taxes.  “Compare that to Ohio,” she said. “They charge about half of that in their state taxes. So their prices are much lower.”  By the time New Yorkers head back to work, she said, prices will likely start creeping back up.  “[If] they start raising that work-from-home limit, yeah, prices are going to go up,” she said. “There'll be a higher demand, but it's hard to say how much.”",true

43b52abb,"Software issue in Michigan gave Biden an estimated 6,000 Trump votes","Editor note and update: Since our original article was published, the Michigan secretary of state’s office has published a notice explaining that the Antrim county reporting mistake resulted from a user error, not a software error, and did not affect the election results or other counties or states.  —  ANTRIM COUNTY, MI -This is an update to an earlier report we filed about a computer “glitch” in Antrim County, Michigan which was reported to have only affected two Republican votes in the important swing state.  However, the Detroit Free Press is reporting it was much, much worse.  According to Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican who ran unopposed and won a third term on Tuesday in a very strong Republican county, results on electronic tapes and a computer card were apparently accurate, however when the results were transcribed from the cards to a computer, something appeared to be wrong.  In 2016, President Trump won the county with around 62% of the vote, compared to 33% for Hillary Clinton. The president outpolled Clinton by 4,000 votes.  Wednesday morning after the election, results in the county showed Biden leading the president by around 3,000 votes with 98% of precincts reporting. Nothing to see here, right?  Guy said that officials hadn’t checked the results prior to posting them, however later asked:  “How could Democrats take over this county?”  Clearly, that made zero sense.  She said that officials were going over the tape of the results and inputting the numbers manually.  Antrim uses Dominion voting equipment and doesn’t use cellular modems to transmit results from precincts to county offices. Rather, the data is transported by election officials, Guy said.  She originally noted she was in talks with the company that maintains the equipment but said it could be the result of “human error.”  Tom McMillin, a former state lawmaker from Oakland County told the Detroit Free Press that he is estimating that both President Trump and US Senate Candidate John James could realize between 4,000-5,000 votes each.  Joe Gumm, a local news anchor with KXXV-TV tweeted about Michigan’s use of the same Election Source program and noted that 33 other counties used that same possibly compromised program to compile their vote totals.  A political commentator, Dennis Lennox also questioned the vote totals from other counties in the state.  “Trump did not lose #AntrimCounty in #Michigan. It is now confirmed that 32 other counties use the same software as Antrim County. He will get 6,000 plus votes out of Antrim. What about the other counties with the same software?” he tweeted.  But according to AFP:  Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office released a statement on November 7 explaining what went wrong in Antrim, and how it was corrected.  “The error in reporting unofficial results in Antrim County Michigan was the result of a user error that was quickly identified and corrected; did not affect the way ballots were actually tabulated; and would have been identified in the county canvass before official results were  reported even if it had not been identified earlier,” the statement said.  The software program, Election Source, worked properly and correctly counted votes, but the county missed an operation step, the statement said. This resulted in a miscommunication between the software and the county’s central election management system that was quickly corrected.  “This was an isolated error, there is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state, and if it did it would be caught during county canvasses, which are conducted by bipartisan boards of county canvassers.”  Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy is quoted on the county’s Facebook page: “We continue to work hard to ensure the integrity of the election results.”  It will be interesting to see if the 138,339 vote dump that went to Biden under the cover of darkness early Wednesday morning , with The Federalist noting that “Biden somehow got all of the votes, and Trump got none, zero, in an overnight vote-dump.”  An apparent “issue” with an election ballot counting program caused only two votes to be tallied for Republican candidates. The problem is being blamed on programming “infrastructure” and could be prevalent through other counties across the state of Michigan.  Two major races are impacted by this “issue”: President, with Joe Biden now leading Donald Trump in the state; and United States Senate, with John James losing to Democratic incumbent Gary Peters.  The problem was discovered Wednesday morning. Republican state legislator Triston Cole heard of the two votes cast for Representative Jack Bergman in his county that were counted, and responded:  “I can guarantee that there were 6 [Bergman votes] in my immediate family alone.”  Election results are no longer posted on the county’s website, and county authorities released an official statement:  “Early this morning, the Antrim County Clerk, Sheryl Guy, became aware of apparently skewed results in the Unofficial Election Result tabulations.  Since then, the Clerk’s Office has been reviewing the results and the multiple redundancies to search out any possible discrepancies. Staff is currently working with township officials and with Election Source, the company that provides the voting software programs and hardware.”  Sheryl Guy reported that vote totals on printed tabulator tapes and totals counted by the election software did not match. The printed tabulated tapes from each precinct will now be counted manually as a result.  There have been more than 16,000 votes cast in Antrim County.  Michigan Republican party chairperson Laura Cox stated:  “The irregularities reported this morning are incredibly troubling, especially given how close the election results are in Michigan.”  On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed suit against the state of Michigan, claiming poll observers had been denied access to polling sites.  Trump campaign statement on #Michigan lawsuit pic.twitter.com/T7FSfp3MVA — Team Trump (Text VOTE to 88022) (@TeamTrump) November 4, 2020  Like neighboring state Wisconsin, Michigan is claiming record voter turnout – a claim that draws both pride and skepticism. Reports and rumors of tons of ballots mysteriously appearing in the middle of the night have cast doubt on these turnout claims.  Officially, Michigan is claiming that more than 5,260,000 citizens have voted.  Challengers to election results for and against both parties have arrived at polling locations in the state. The TCF Convention Center is Detroit is ground zero for these groups, with about 50 challengers representing the Republicans. Other groups include the ACLU, NAACP, and union group representatives.  Branden Snyder, executive director of Detroit Action, a housing and economic justice group stated:  “We got a call that they needed more volunteers. Our goal is to make sure the process is fair and equal.”  It is unknown on what authority Mr. Snyder used in his action afterwards, but when more than 100 opposing challengers arrived at the TCF Center, he turned them away for the day.  In other election irregularities, the United States Postal Service (USPS) failed to comply with a federal court order, effectively ignoring the order. The USPS indicated that it couldn’t meet the 3 p.m. deadline set by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan for facilities to sweep their buildings for mail-in ballots.  As judge orders USPS to do twice-daily sweeps for remaining ballots, @APWUnational president says postal workers “moved heaven and earth” to count the record mail-in ballots “as a civic duty.” https://t.co/cB1cVIbEMq — Dinah Voyles Pulver (@DinahVP) November 6, 2020  The USPS also failed to comply with an order to allow election inspectors to inspect mail service in places like Detroit to make sure all mailed in ballots had been deposited at election drop-off sites.  Postmaster General Louis DeJoy filed a response to Judge Sullivan’s order, indicating the service didn’t have enough inspectors to cover the task.  USPS processed 150,000 ballots after Election Day, jeopardizing thousands of votes https://t.co/RDW0V0Nwpo — Bo Snerdley (@BoSnerdley) November 6, 2020  There will certainly be a discussion and possible sanctions over the “apparent lack of compliance with the Court’s order,” according to an after-action order filed by Sullivan.  He did acknowledge the USPS postmaster’s efforts and would likely let them continue their operation in reference to the election.

John James campaign accusing local officials of voter suppression and election interference in Michigan Senate race  November 5, 2020  DETROIT, MI- As Michigan continued to count ballots the day after Election Day, Republican John James’ Senate campaign accused local officials of impropriety, voter suppression, and election interference after incumbent Gary Peters picked up hundreds of thousands of votes overnight.  John James Campaign Claims Irregularities in Michigan Senate Race https://t.co/10NvXMvL1D — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 5, 2020  Fox News reported that James’ allegations came as chaos unfolded outside a vote tally room at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit where all mail-in absentee ballots were being collected. The chaos caused officials to place cardboard over the window in order to obstruct the public’s view as well as bar individuals from coming into the room.  Stuart Sandler, a consultant for James’ campaign, who also observed the count as a volunteer lawyer, told Fox News that they believe there were “a lot of irregularities” throughout the process that must be looked into. Sandler said in a statement:  “There were all kinds of chicanery, including ballots that came in reportedly in the middle of the night at 3:30 a.m. 35,000 ballots that were deceptively brought in.”  He added:  “There have been a lot of irregularities and lack of integrity. They’re not letting challengers in, they’re not letting them get food or water. When they do, they’re not letting them come back. There are all sorts of disruptions to the process.”  John James campaign alleges irregularities, lack of integrity in Michigan vote counthttps://t.co/HniuNxpg8R — Fox News (@FoxNews) November 5, 2020  Up until the early mornings hours on Wednesday, November 4, James was holding a significant lead. Sandler has alleged that Mark Brewer, a former state Democratic chairman, organized the arrival of dozens of lawyers and activists to the TCF Center in order to “disrupt the process.” Sandler said:  “There’s a lack of integrity there. The people of Michigan made their choice and they’ve been trying to disrupt the process and we’re reviewing our options.”  Michigan’s Republican Senate Campaign for John James Alleges Election Interference https://t.co/VEgc0lZLQC — Dr. Carol M. Swain (@carolmswain) November 5, 2020  However, Brewer insisted that the process of counting ballots has been the cleanest and most effective Detroit has ever had. He said in a statement to the Associated Press:  “This is the best absentee ballot counting operation that Detroit has ever had. They are counting ballots very efficiently, despite the obstructing tactics of the Republicans.”  Still, a source close to James’ campaign said:  “Poll challengers weren’t even able to get close enough to the ballot for the voter rolls to confirm that the ballots are credible, that people didn’t already vote.”  .@GaryPeters laughed out loud when asked what he makes of @JohnJamesMI campaign allegations of irregularities with election results.

However, by the morning of November 4th, a sourced alleged that that total increased to 5.6 million with the majority going up in places like Detroit.  As the Trump campaign lawsuit is dismissed, Republican Senate candidate John James called for an investigation into election results, refusing to concede.https://t.co/P3iOiZLibO — The Michigan Daily (@michigandaily) November 5, 2020  Former State Sen. Patrick Colbeck, who is a registered poll watcher and was on the scene, told Fox News that what he witnessed was an “obfuscation and a complete lack of transparency.” He said in a statement:  “We’re being expressly denied the access to the ballot count area, at the most critical time. And you know, it’s very telling.”  He added:  “I can tell you right now, it’s not a free and fair election and I’ve been watching this for quite a while. So, get the word out, Democrats are attempting to steal the election and the best way to go off and fight back on this is to let people know what’s happening.”  Wow! It looks like Michigan has now found the ballots necessary to keep a wonderful young man, John James, out of the U.S. Senate. What a terrible thing is happening! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 4, 2020  The complaints from the James campaign follow the announcement from President Donald Trump’s campaign also alleging a lack of access to counting stations. Trump 2020 campaign manager, Bill Stepien, said in a statement:  “President Trump’s campaign has not been provided with meaningful access to numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process, as guaranteed by Michigan law.”  _________  Want to make sure you never miss a story from Law Enforcement Today?

2f4df790,Closing The Mexico Border Would Affect The U.S. Avocado Supply Greatly,"UPDATE: April 3, 2019, 2:50 PM  Bloomberg reports Hass Avocado prices surged Tuesday as the result of importers stockpiling produce. However, things may get worse. Vice president and senior analyst at Rabobank, Roland Fumasi, told Bloomberg that prices could ""easily double or triple if we shut down the border.""  ORIGINAL STORY: April 1, 2019, 3:40 P.M.  As President Trump continues his threats to close the border, analysts are looking at how that would impact Americans' food supply. In a report published today, Reuters cited recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture that says nearly half of all imported vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruits are grown in Mexico.  While there are other countries that produce the fruits and vegetables we consume, it would take time to adjust trade plans. One of the most imminent problems we'd face would be an avocado shortage, should the border actually close in the next week.  Steve Barnard, the president of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world, told Reuters that because Mexico supplies most of the avocados sold in the U.S. at this time of year, closing the border would mean running out of avocados in as little as three weeks.  California's growing season is just starting, so avocados grown there wouldn't be ready for another month or so. Of note, Barnard told Reuters that California has a ""very small crop."" Depending on how long trade was halted, that could mean fewer avocados in stores and higher prices on the ones that are available.  Other produce that could be in short supply include tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries, and raspberries, the majority of which all currently come from Mexico.

30c605a1,"CDC Exposed: Inflated Covid Deaths By 1600% Throughout The Election, “Violated Multiple Federal Laws” Peer-Reviewed Study Finds...State, Local Governments Must Act","Throughout the election, Donald Trump was battered by CCP Virus statistics in order to hurt the American economy and his political campaign. We know that it was shamelessly wielded as a political weapon to prevent President Trump and his supporters from rallying as Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned progressive poor and minority neighborhoods to the ground throughout the entire year. Now that Biden has been installed into the office of president, he promises to increase Covid lockdown measures and extend them further into your ability to travel and force unscientific mask-wearing for at least 100 days.  But, a new peer reviewed study has been released that finds the CDC numbers to be so wildly unsupported as to be pure propaganda that is based on wholly unscientific practices that were needlessly created on-the-spot.  The National File Reports  “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE.  CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson.”  The study is 25 pages long with over 100 citations. However, the main main points can be summarized.  A major point is that testing inaccuracies and unreliability combined with unscientific procedures and methods resulted in demonstrably massive false-positive spikes:  “The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. (READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine).”  There are also profound legal implications raised by the study that need to be dealt with in courts around the country if America is to ever be free again. The data you have been spoonfed by the CDC for a year raises serious legal issues. Much like the 2020 election, massive changes in rules for reporting and collecting data were instituted exclusively for Covid which resulted in a 1600% inflated number of fatalities:  “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. (Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative) Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study.  “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.”  But that is not all. Other major Covid collection and reporting standards created on March 24th of 2020 that inexplicably and intentionally changed decades old practices in order to hide comorbidities and preexisting health conditions on death reports. These underlying health conditions may likely have been the actual or most important cause of death:  “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens.  And, still, there is MORE! Last spring the CDC created covid-19-exclusive rules that violated federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development and wrote new rules to count probable cases without any definitive proof of infection. The new rules also allowed tracers to practice medicine without a license while disallowing any measures to be put in place to prevent a patient from being counted multiple times:  “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection (section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5), new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license (section VII.A3 – page 5), and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case (section VII.B – page 7),” stated All Concerned Citizens.  Why would those in power wish to do such inhumane things to the entire population of America?  The National File concludes:  “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.”  There is much more to the report, and we suggest that you read it at the link provided in the beginning of this article.  All data since last year suggest that Covid-19 hysteria is part of an orchestrated coup against Western values, nations, and laws.  At what point will the evidence and data be enough to break the spell cast on millions of Americans by the Covid Cult?  Please, bring this report to your local officials and insist that they read it and reverse the policies being implemented and ramped up across the country or America is surely dead.",false
1abdbb0e,"Rep. Vos, Sen. Fitzgerald: Gov. Evers’ plan provides roadblocks to reopening Wisconsin","Madison, WI…Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester) and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau) released the following statement after the Evers administration announced guidelines for reopening the state.  “Instead of listening to the resounding outcry from the people of the state, Governor Evers is now making it harder to reopen Wisconsin. He claims to be following the CDC guidelines, but instead is expanding on them, saying we need to hire 1000 new contract tracers when positive cases aren’t significantly increasing. The governor also wants to postpone reopening until we increase testing when we are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity. These are not criteria for reopening, they’re roadblocks.  “While DHS reports that 60% of counties have fewer than 10 cases, and 10% have none, Governor Evers is doubling down on his plan to keep the entire state locked down until after Memorial Day, well past every state in the region.  “We continue to call on the governor to retreat from his one-size-fits-all approach and allow the state to safely open up regionally so people can get back to work. Wisconsin is a diverse state; obviously, the Northwoods can’t be treated like Dane and Milwaukee counties. Using the CDC guidelines, it appears portions of the state would be only days away from the first phase of reopening.  “Wisconsinites need certainty during these uncertain times. As we have seen too often throughout the pandemic, the governor says something one day and the opposite the next. That is why we can’t afford to withdraw our impending legal action. Too much is at stake. It’s clear one person shouldn’t be allowed to unilaterally rule over businesses, families and the state’s future.”",partially false
9332ac22,Flu Vaccine Deaths in South Korea risen to nearly 100; Prime Minister asks for Investigation,"After the Korean Medical Association had called on Seoul to stop the flu vaccination program for a review, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun finally called for an investigation for the safety issues. This is because the death toll in South Korea after getting flu vaccines has rose to 97; as reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) last week.  The KDCA, however, still denies that there is a connection between these seemingly genocidal phenomena and the vaccines being used in the government’s free flu shot program. What’s more disturbing is that the KCDA still urges the SK citizens to continue getting vaccination despite the growing number of dead flu vaccine recipients.  To some, this is not surprising for an institution like the KCDA. Such organizations claiming to be in charge of diseases control and prevention, while ironically tainted with conflicts of interest, have been proven to be untrustworthy and deceiving when it comes to science many times in history. For example, a report from Children’s Health Defence (CHD) website stated the following:  “The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone aged six months and up, including pregnant women, get an annual flu shot to protect against the influenza virus. The mainstream media characterize this recommendation as being firmly grounded in science. The demonstrable truth of the matter, however, is that what the government and media say science says and what science actually tells us are two completely different things.”  What’s more diabolical is that they even recommend this flu vaccine to pregnant women! On the same report, the CHD website also wrote:  “The CDC’s recommendation that pregnant women get the flu shot is all the more disturbing given the fact that multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine contain the preservative Thimerosal, which is half ethylmercury by weight. Ethylmercury is a known neurotoxin that can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. It can also cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the developing fetus.”  Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the flu vaccine being used to the SK citizens has contributed or probably the main cause of death. Even if the manufacturers and the state health departments often deny it, common sense would tell us that substances containing heavy metals such as mercury and aluminium, not to mention dozens of other questionable and alarming agents in the vaccine, are very detrimental and should not be put in a human’s body.  For instance, during the last year’s United Nation (UN) summit regarding vaccination, doctors and other experts admitted that there has been no proof that vaccines are safe and effective. In a report published in the naturalnews.com, Dr. Stephen Evans, a Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology stated in the video:  “It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity (vaccine adverse reactions and side effects) in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen…”  Despite the claims by the proponents of vaccines, a peer-reviewed study reveals that unvaccinated people are most protected against influenza (flu). In one of its numerous reports about flu vaccines, globalresearch.ca wrote:  “At least six separate studies conducted by the same people that are still pushing the flu shot have confirmed that seasonal flu shots make people more prone to contracting the flu. The evidence is now overwhelming that, rather than impart immunity as long claimed, flu shots actually destroy the immune system and increase the risk of infection.”  References:  Featured image: https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/deaths-rattle-south-korea-s-seasonal-flu-vaccination-but-authority-presses-ahead-free",partially false
1f33d253,UN Forced to Admit Gates-funded Vaccine Is Causing Polio Outbreak in Africa - Global Research,"This really should be one of the biggest public health scandals of the decade, but instead it’s given little attention – mainly because of the high-profile nature of the people and organisations involved.  ***  The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out.  While international organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO) will regularly boast about ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines—the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa.  Health officials have now admitted that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed by a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent wave of polio to spread.  This latest pharma-induced pandemic started out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, with the culprit identified as vaccine-derived polio virus type 2.  Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world.  Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the a pharmaceutical vaccine. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine (mOPV2) following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio.  The same incident has happened in India as well.  It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine is being pushed by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  All of this should be cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giants all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population.  Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African populationthrough GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials is taking place in South Africa, run by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—another Gates-funded institution.  This latest revelation from Africa should prompt journalists and health advocates to ask harder questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hype COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine.  AP News reports…  LONDON (AP) — The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad — a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted across Africa and elsewhere, leaving millions of children vulnerable to infection. In April, WHO and its partners reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to mass polio immunization campaigns, recognizing the move could lead to a resurgence of the disease. In May, they reported that 46 campaigns to vaccinate children against polio had been suspended in 38 countries, mostly in Africa, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the campaigns have recently been re-started, but health workers need to vaccinate more than 90% of children in their efforts to eradicate the paralytic disease. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed. Wild polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan; both countries also are struggling to contain outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio.  *  Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

On the panel, Missouri Republican Party Executive Director Jean Evans and attorney Jane Dueker talked crime in St. Louis, among other topics.  “Missouri, in general, has more crime, percentage-wise, than the rest of the country. So we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri,” said Evans.  Last week marked the official launch of Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to combat violent crime in the region. The same week, St. Louis elected officials passed the Cure Violence plan.  To Evans, Parson stepping in “takes political courage” and puts much-needed boots on the ground.  “Freeing up some more police officers, because you don’t go in and rob a bank when there is a cop car outside,” Evans said.  Dueker noted the police officers “are grateful for any sort of help.”  But, that is just one step to addressing the issue, she said.  “I think you have to do a multifaceted approach, and I’m not exactly seeing that yet. The bottom line is the most dangerous people have to be taken off the streets,” Dueker said. “You have to have a short-term solution, a medium-term solution, and a long-term solution. The short-term solution has to be to get the most dangerous people off the streets. Ten percent of the people are committing 90 percent of the crime. … We need, one, to get them off the street, and then we need someone who will actually prosecute them to keep them in.”  Tune in for the whole show as guests discuss an impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump, the special election in HD 99, and protections for pregnant women in prison.",partially false
d72c2323,BLM Has Rules for Whites Attending Protests,"0 SHARES Share Tweet  BLM pasted these “rules” for “white folks” attending protests on social media. Many whites wanted to stand in unity with their fellow blacks to protest the unjust killing of George Floyd’s.  In a moment of unity, these rules seem more degrading and racist towards white people. Among some of the rules, they request whites to “stay in the back until you are called forward. If you hear “White people to the front” or “Allies to the front” step forward and link arms with other white people to form a human shield.”  So they asked that all whites stay in the back and link arms with other whites, not blacks.  Seems those that are crying for equality don’t want equality, they want superiority over whites.  Unity is when we unite side by side together in a common goal. So why would they not use this moment to show that we can all one?  BLM Mohawk Kuzma said this in 2014:  “As organizer of the largest Black Lives Matter marches in Seattle since 2014, Mohawk Kuzma has had a front-row seat to the transforming demographics of the BLM movement. He says that my eyes are not deceiving me. There is a noticeable increase of white marchers, one that he says signifies that white Seattleites’ long hibernation on Black issues is at its end.  “The reason BLM marches are getting more white is because more white people are waking up and seeing the covert segregation and racial injustice and racism,” Kuzma tells me. “We see it on the news every day across the nation.”  He draws a connection with the overt displays of racism, from pervasive police killings of blacks to the recent domestic terrorist acts by white supremacists, most recently a school shooting by one in New Mexico  Kuzma says that when he began organizing he welcomed whatever race, gender, or orientation felt compelled to attend, as long as the marchers understood “that all black lives matter and racial injustice, police brutality, and racism needed to stop.”  However, he also recognizes that the increased numbers of white folks is a double-edged sword.  “More white people also brings white ignorance and white fragility,” he says. “White people think they have to be respectful during a protest. Sorry, but we as black people don’t get respect from anyone, including white people, so why should we be respectful. We are here to get stuff done.”  During the Civil War, it was white people that fought for the freedom of slaves. At that time the north had 22 million people against slavery while the south had 9 million. 4 million of them were slaves. It was white people that ran the underground railroad. It has always true that more white people are fighting for equal rights than not. Though many seem to want to overlook this historical fact.  This movement is an American movement and we should have mutual respect for each other. We should treat each other how we expect to be treated.

c03ed5db,Canadian Govt Publishes Bid Request For “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” Needed “in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19”,"Is Canada building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit? As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing…  by Mike Adams of Natural News  (Natural News) The Canadian government, on its official acquisition website (Buyandsell.gc.ca) is requesting bids for “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” as part of, “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.”  The listing number is 45045-190091/A, and it is found at this link:  https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-PD-005-78707  Additional details on the bid include:  Reference number: PW-$$PD-005-78707  Solicitation number: 45045-190091/A  Region of delivery: National Capital Region  Notice type: Notice of Proposed Procurement (NPP)  GSIN: N7520: Office Devices and Accessories  Procurement entity: Public Works and Government Services Canada  The “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” listing on the Canadian government’s website is explained on the site as “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.”  “Guillotine” is a term that describes a mechanical device with a powerful chopping blade that can slice things apart. Although there are industrial uses for cutting devices — such as in the book publishing industry — the term “guillotine” specifically refers to a device intended to execute human beings.  As the Cambridge online dictionary explains, “guillotine” is a device that’s used to kill people by cutting off their heads:  Here’s an image of a paper cutting machine, which is more commonly called a “shear” or cutting machine. This is not a guillotine, even though paper cutting companies might be used as a front for acquiring actual guillotines:  Antifa and left-wing BLM terrorists have recently displayed mock-up guillotines on the streets of America as part of their protest actions, demanding that the people with whom they disagree be executed via guillotine. Guillotines were also used in the French Revolution to execute political dissidents who opposed the incoming socialist regime.  Canadian official asks why covid camps are being constructed in Canada, gets silenced  It is difficult to imagine how guillotines would be needed to respond to COVID-19 unless Canada was building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit to mass vaccinations. As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing. See this article: Canadian government erecting a network of covid detainment camps and “isolation” sites to incarcerate those who don’t cooperate with medical tyranny. As that article explains:  Justin Trudeau and the Canadian government are creating Nazi Germany-like infrastructure to detain human beings en masse, and for years to come. A brave Ontario politician named Randy Hillier spoke out about the government’s nefarious detainment plan in a provincial question period in front of the government of Ontario. His microphone was cut off as soon as he started asking the tough questions.  Randy Hillier, Independent Ontario MPP for Lanark, Frontenac and Kingston, stood up and questioned the government, asking how many people will be detained and how many concentration camps are scheduled for construction. He expressed concern about their current use — to control the spread of covid-19 — and pointed out in documentation that these sites could be used for “other requirements” in the future.  “So your government must be in negotiations and aware of these plans to potentially detain and isolate citizens and residents of our country and our province,” Hillier began. “So speaker, to the Premier, where will these camps be built, how many people will be detained, and for what reason, for what reasons can people be kept in these isolation camps, and I’d like to have the Premier assure the people of Ontario…,” Hillier’s microphone was cut off before he could finish.  See the video here, which has been banned from YouTube:  Additional details on the hydraulic guillotines request from the Canadian government  Solicitation document #ABES.PROD.PW__PD.B005.E78707.EBSU000 reveals additional details about the bid request:  The bid document lists technical requirements for the guillotines, under a heading called “Guillotines Mandatory Requirements:”  The Guillotine’s cutting and clamping systems must be fully hydraulic;  The Guillotine’s automatic blade and clamp must return from every position to its original  starting position;  starting position; The Guillotine’s blade depth adjustment(s) must be achievable from outside of the  Guillotine;  Guillotine; The Guillotine’s measurement readout must be in imperial measurement;  The Guillotine’s blade changing tool, wrenches/screwdrivers and cutting block must be  provided for each Guillotine;  The document also calls for a “1 year parts and labour warranty” to make sure the guillotine continues running smoothly so that the chopping isn’t interrupted.  Is this bid for industrial use, or something more sinister?  A skeptic might look at this government bid and conclude it must be a bid for cutting equipment to be used in cutting books, stacks of papers or posters. One of the companies involved in the bid appears to be a printing company, for example. But wouldn’t that also be the perfect cover story for acquiring actual guillotines intended for a more sinister purpose?  Given that Canada is already in the process of constructing covid “concentration camps” — while touting this guillotine bid as part of “Canada’s response to COVID-19,” many people will have serious questions about the intended use of these devices as well as the language used to describe them.  If these were merely industrial cutting machines, wouldn’t the listing just say, “Cutting Machine” instead of “Guillotines?”  And given the history of guillotines being used during radical left-wing revolutions in France, many people are wondering whether China’s corruption of modern-day Canada — including its French-speaking regions — means that China is planning to round up and execute anyone resisting communist influences in Canada. With Justin Trudeau now appearing to be a political puppet of China — much like Joe Biden — and with Chinese troops already staged in Western Canada, these are no longer idle questions.  See this important story: Western Canada has already fallen to Communist China – America may have a chance, but only if it stands united.  Dave Hodges of The Commonsense Show recently published an article describing plans to round up Americans and incarcerate them in Canadian concentration camps run by communist Chinese. That article explains:  Steve Quayle and myself have been investigating a three-nation deal involving Communist China, Canada and the United States. The deal has now expanded to NATO forces, living in American bases that were closed during the Bush Sr., era. The CSS has also learned that their is some UN involvement as well. The agreements have to do with ridding America’s new Harris-Biden administration of any and all. Unfortunately, the interview that is presented below on this topic is a work in progress. The implications of this interview is frightening as it promises an international, state-sponsored genocidal program against “deplorables” who will oppose the real new world order.  As all this is happening, Trudeau is accelerating Canada’s gun control and gun confiscation efforts to make sure that Canadian citizens have no ability to fight back when the government comes to their homes and kidnaps them, depositing them in Canada’s COVID concentration camps.  Americans, on the other hand, will never give up their guns. Count on it.",false
a329a5b3,"Josh Mandel discloses finances, showing his wife with extensive holdings in a trust","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012, on Friday released a copy of his delinquent personal financial disclosure report, a 47-page document showing his wife to be a millionaire with extensive investments held in a family trust.  At a minimum, Ilana Shafran Mandel's holdings are worth $1.95 million. But they could be worth as much as $7.1 million, based on a range of valuations in her husband's financial disclosure report.  Annual income from the trust was at least $860,000 last year and could have been as high as $1.8 million, thanks to dividends, capital gains, rent from real estate and distributions from gas and natural resource partnerships  Mandel's personal financial report was due to the Senate clerk on May 15, little more than a month after he signed candidacy papers on April 5. But he said the complexity and structure of his wife's finances presented questions he needed to resolve in order to file the form correctly. He said the $200 fine he'll have to pay under Senate rules is a fair price for accuracy.  Democrats derided the presumptive GOP Senate nominee for his continued lateness, suggesting he might be hiding something. Keenly aware of the criticism, the Mandel campaign hand-delivered the report to reporters around midday Friday -- yet kept Democrats who wanted to pore over it waiting by choosing to submit it to the Senate via mail. The Senate is likely to receive it early next week.  This frustrated Democratic activists who were waiting for the filing to show up at the Senate clerk's office by the 6 p.m. Friday closing time.  ""For nearly six months Josh Mandel broke the law and illegally refused to disclose his personal finances despite every other major Senate candidate in the country being in compliance, and now in an effort to continue his evasion tactics, he files a report which is still not yet available to the public on the weekend before the biggest election in the country this year,"" said Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky.  Based on the copy of the report released to the press, the overwhelming majority of Mandel assets are held for his wife in the JMS Trust -- short for the Joseph M. Shafran Children's Trust. Joseph Shafran is Ilana's father, and his mother -- Ilana's grandmother -- was an immigrant who with her siblings founded a lumber business that grew into Forest City Enterprises. Today, Ilana's trust-held stock in Forest City, a publicly traded company, is worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000.  Her other stock holdings through the trust are extensive and include Avon Products, General Electric, J. P. Morgan Chase, McDonalds, Microsoft, Sherwin-Williams and Time Warner. The trust also has an array of bond holdings including Bank of America, the Hamilton County Sewer System, and the Medina County Library. It also is invested in mutual funds, real estate, gas and natural resource partnerships, and a small stake in Wicked People Tour Inc., which Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said is related to the Broadway show ""Wicked.""  Mandel, a Marine veteran who expects to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown next year, is not personally wealthy. He reported his income as state treasurer as $82,477, and his personal investments are worth as little as $60,000 or as much as $375,000, excluding a Lyndhurst condo he and his wife rent out, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.  Brown, who filed his annual disclosure report in May, has a small range of holdings worth as little as $435,010 or as much as $1 million, based on the ranges of values in his report.",true

Kamala Harris of California was caught in a major lie Wednesday night at the 2020 vice presidential debate, directly contradicting a history of promises from her and her running mate to defend against claims a Biden-Harris administration would ban American hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas.  The claim came as Harris sparred with incumbent Vice President Mike Pence over how best to address the issue of climate change.  “Joe Biden will not end fracking,” Harris said. “He has been very clear about that.”  Harris would provide no explanation and no qualifiers, her campaign simply going on to suggest the claim was “fact” in a statement published to Twitter moments later.  .@JoeBiden will not ban fracking.

According to the Washington Examiner, Harris herself suggested during a town hall hosted by CNN in the heat of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary last September that she would take action to ban hydraulic fracturing on public lands on “day one” if elected president.  “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris told the audience.

It was apparently not radical enough, however, to keep Harris’ running mate, the supposedly moderate Biden, from falling in line as well.  Several sharp-eyed social media users were quick to point out the discrepancy on Twitter, posting several individual videos, and even a few super-cut compilations, of Biden promising there would be “no more, no new fracking” under his administration.

Using FaceTime, taking selfies with the driver or showing the driver a funny cat video is a no-no.” In most provinces a mobile phone is categorised as a “visual display unit”, meaning it is considered akin to a television screen.

30c605a1,Missouri lawmakers condemn Las Vegas shooting,"Missouri politicians have made statements after the mass shooting late Sunday night in Las Vegas.  In a tweet, Republican Senator Roy Blunt said he was saddened by the tragic loss of life and that his thoughts were with the families affected by” this horrific attack”.  Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill issued a statement strongly condemning the action and offering support law enforcement personnel looking into the matter.  “Firing upon a crowd of innocent concert goers is an act of unimaginable evil and my deepest condolences go out to all those affected by this tragic event,” said McCaskill. “I will continue to closely monitor the situation and pledge my support to all local, state, and federal law enforcement officials involved in this investigation.”  Republican Lieutenant Governor Mike Parson, a former Sheriff, praised the response of law enforcement to the shooting spree and expressed regret over the occurrence.  “While my words can be of little comfort to the victims of this senseless act of violence, it should bring comfort to all Americans to see the quick response of local law enforcement and first responders to stop the gunman and help victims, and fellow Americans helping to get others to safety,” Parson said. “My deepest sympathies go out to everyone affected.”  Republican Governor Eric Greitens posted a short message on Facebook, saying “Our prayers are with the people affected by last night’s tragic and evil violence in Las Vegas.”  Republican State Representative Nick Marshall of Parkville is a National Rifle Association member and an outspoken supporter of gun rights. Marshall hasn’t released a formal statement, but when reached for comment by Missourinet, was critical of the inquiry and said the Las Vegas shooter’s use of automatic weapons was not a state issue.  “I can’t believe that we would, within hours of a mass shooting, be talking politics on this. That’s the disturbing thing to me right now to hear about. I get a call from someone who wants to talk about politics in a mass shooting,” said Marshall. “When it comes to automatic weapons, that’s a federal issue as you know.”  Marshall went on to stress the involvement of human shortcomings in the incident. “It’s nothing other than a human tragedy for our country. I think what it shows, it shows we’ve got some serious cultural issues, some serious heart issues in the nation.”  After Governor Greitens had metal detectors installed in the state capitol this year and restricted people from entering with guns, Marshall offered his own an alternative.  On his Facebook page and his office door, Marshall posted the message “effective immediately, any constituent of mine with a CCW that was not allowed to bring his firearm into the Capitol may stop by my office and borrow one for the duration of the visit.”  One of the Missouri legislature’s most fierce proponents of gun restrictions is Democratic Representative Stacy Newman of Richmond Heights. She told Missourinet that Marshall wasn’t exactly correct about federal oversight of automatic weapons, citing 2011 legislation passed by state lawmakers known as House Bill 294.  “Part of this omnibus gun bill that year legalizing machine guns in the state of Missouri. We legalized them here. And ever since then, continually my whole time in the legislature, we have loosened restriction.”  Newman also said voters have failed to hold lawmakers responsible for current laws which allow access to rapid fire weapons. “We elect people and then expect them to change their spots when they are in office. They’re not going to do it because they’re answering to the gun lobby. The gun lobby only cares about more sales. That’s it”.  Austin Petersen, a Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate seat held by McCaskill, expressed sadness over the shooting and asked for unity in overcoming it.  “I’m heartbroken over the tragic event in Las Vegas yesterday,” Petersen said. “This horrendous act of violence touches and hurts us all as a nation and we must come together to heal and find answers. I send my most sincere condolences to all of the victims and their families. Please help and love one another.”  Petersen has criticized Facebook for banning him from the site for 30 days after he posted a live stream video of himself talking about an AR-15 rifle he’s giving away. An AR-15 is a semi-automatic weapon.  During an interview with Missourinet Columbia affiliate KSSZ, Petersen said ban was politically motivated. “Facebook’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has donated the maximum amount allowable to my opponent Claire McCaskill, so something’s fishy.”  At least 58 people have died from Sunday night’s mass shooting in Las Vegas, which also injured more than 500 people",partially false
c3dea290,CBC Cuts Donald Trump's 'Home Alone 2' Cameo Out of Broadcast,"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is full of violence that, in my opinion, exceeds the physical comedy of the original film and is borderline barbarism. The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That’s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump’s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.

One could argue that Trump wasn’t a political figure in the public’s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama’s birth certificate—so I don’t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I’m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump’s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can’t decide if this is hilarious or sad.

f14e8eb6,Obama’s Daughters Caught on Camera Burning US Flag at DC Protest – iolgue,"But things took a turn for the worse when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, all to clear the way for President Donald Jebediah Trump to waddle across the street for a photo op in front of a church he doesn’t attend, wave around a copy of a holy book he doesn’t read, and ramble like a psychotic dictator of a country he doesn’t love.  Sasha and Malia had come to the protest equipped with military-grade gas masks, so they were not overcome by the tear gas that crippled so many of their fellow protestors. They stood still in front of the advancing police, trying to give others a chance to escape the rubber bullets and tear gas.  As the police shoved their way through the peaceful crowd, an enraged officer ripped an American flag out of the hands of a group of high school students who were standing silently, holding the flag, and refusing to give up their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.  Just then, recognizing the Obama daughters, the cop wadded up the flag, lit a corner of it on fire, waved to a news camera from OAN, and threw the burning flag at Sasha and Malia.  The Obamas, horrified to see a flag being burned, stretched it out between them to try to keep more of it from catching fire. That’s when the camera caught the image of them, holding a burning American flag.  Presidential historian Sandy Batt, who has always hated made-up stories about the Obama girls, rolled her eyes and said,  “Oh for god’s sake, people will really think they burned a U.S. flag,” when she was reached for comment.

Last year, it was revealed by the FBI that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. But, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails.  The reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons.  An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.  Chief Inspector of the Department of Investigation, Joe Barron, gave his thoughts about the case, saying the details were sickening.  “What we have discovered over the past few months has been disturbing, to say the least. This goes to very very highest levels. No one could have predicted this. Only the foil hats would have thought this to be possible. Schiff looks to be the ringleader of the operation, arranging the trades and handled the financing. I can’t say anything else since it’s a nonexistent investigation, but rest assured justice will be served. In America, no one is above the law, except the rich.”  This is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. It was well-known that Schiff and Epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that Epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected. This explains the impeachment hoax, since he was looking for a distraction.  These people are in the highest levels of government and need to be found out and prosecuted.

Governor and Secretary of State in Georgia Took Money From China To Steal Election from Trump  UPDATED 8:23 PM EST See Bottom -- Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp and the Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger both allegedly took money from Communist China, perhaps to intentionally THROW or STEAL the November 3 Election in that state, to Joe Biden.  According to very high level sources from my years working National Security Intelligence with the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, the feds have PROOF of the payments to both Kemp and Raffensperger.  The Trump election legal team forced the President to WAIT before revealing this, until both Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the Election results.  According to those same sources, once Kemp and Raffensperger CERTIFIED the results, their crime was complete. Both men certified those election results this week. By law, Mr. Raffensperger was obliged to certify the election results before 5 p.m. on Friday. Gov. Kemp, had to then certify the results by 5 p.m. on Saturday. Both men did exactly those acts.  The implications of this revelation are staggering. First, that a sitting REPUBLICAN Governor would stab his Party's President, and our nation, in the back, for a foreign government, is utterly horrifying. People are already asking  My God, what could they have offered that he would sell out his own people? His own country?  That a foreign nation would DARE to pay money in order to rig or steal a U.S. Presidential Election is . . . a casus belli Cause for war. China appears to have tried to STEAL our freedom by STEALING our Elections. War is justified.  Again, the national security intelligence sources with whom I have spoken, assure me this information is solid and the proof is already in government hands.  MORE . . .  Georgia Governor Brian P.

61bd9a69,FDA Shocking Study: Cells Used In Vaccines Contaminated With Serious Viruses Including Cancer,"November 23, 2019  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA has published shocking results which found that cells used in the manufacturing of numerous childhood vaccines are often contaminated with serious viruses including cancer.  The FDA study looked at vaccines that are made from living cells, or replicated cell substrates that some manufacturers are investigating to create. According to research, these cells are oftentimes contaminated with hidden viral fragments which have the potential to cause cancer.  These viruses are dormant, meaning they live “quietly” inside other cells. However, eventually these cells no longer hide and circulate throughout the body in the form of serious disease. As a result, a person injected with a vaccine containing these cancer-causing micro-organisms may not display signs of health complications until long after they have been jabbed sometimes several years later.  .  An experiment injecting rodents with vaccines yielded surprising results showing that the rats now had tumor cells.  “In some cases the cell lines that are used might be tumorigenic, that is, they form tumors when injected into rodents,” the FDA paper explains.  “Some of these tumor-forming cell lines may contain cancer-causing viruses that are not actively reproducing. Such viruses are hard to detect using standard methods. These latent, or ‘quiet,’ viruses pose a potential threat, since they might become active under vaccine manufacturing conditions.”  The list of tumorigenic or cells that run the risk of causing cancer include MDCK and CHO cells for influenza virus vaccines, 293 and PER.C6 cells for adenovirus-vectored HIV-1 and other vaccines, and tumor-derived cells such as HeLa cells for HIV-1 vaccines according to the FDA.  Although this author is against the injection of foreign chemicals into his own body, the FDA proceeded with the study for other reasons. The FDA writes they want “to ensure the safety of vaccines, our laboratory is investigating ways to activate latent viruses in cell lines and to detect the activated viruses, as well as other unknown viruses, using new technologies. We will then adapt our findings to detect viruses in the same types of cell substrates that are used to produce vaccines.”  The FDA adds, “These methods will enable FDA scientists to help manufacturers to determine whether their specific cell substrate is safe to use for vaccine production. The methods our laboratory are developing and testing will help to ensure the production of safe and effective vaccines in two ways: 1 FDA will be able to develop testing guidelines for manufacturers who use new cell substrates for producing vaccines; and 2 FDA will publish the new methods it develops in peer-reviewed scientific journals, thus making them readily accessible to all manufacturers.”  The FDA is also evaluating the risk of retrovirus infections in humans such as Simian foamy virus SFV which can be transmitted from monkeys to humans. Although, the FDA says “there is no evidence that SFV causes disease.” However, the FDA cautions that the virus can “remain in a lifelong quiet state in the DNA after infection.”  Despite these claims, we know that polio and smallpox vaccines contain monkey, pig, kidney and other foreign cells that are contaminated with SIV, SFV, and various other cancer-causing viruses. Most are also well aware that the Polio vaccine SV40 is documented on record by the CDC themselves on a now-deleted page to have cost people their lives and caused cancer. However, you can confirm the web page existed by using Archive.org’s time machine. Also there’s other evidence that SV40 has been detected in some human tumors.  So the claim made by the CDC “there is no evidence that SFV causes disease” is a laughably ill-researched statement.  In other gene sequencing news, recently it has been reported by scientists in a separate study that there are 560 cancer genes in the human gene sequencing for GlaxoSmithKline’s GSK combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella MMRV.  Cancer genes aren’t the only worry with MMR vaccines or vaccines in general. As Activist Post has previously expressed, mercury and aluminum have long been debated by people like Robert Kennedy Jr . as ingredients adjuvants in vaccines that could cause autism. This is for good reason since we know that both aluminum and mercury are neurotoxins that harm the body at high levels.  RFK, Jr. believes “it’s the preservative Thimerosal in the vaccines that causes autism.”  Kennedy expressed his opinion in a weighty now-deleted piece on the CDC whistleblower entitled “CDC’s Latest Tuskegee Experiment African American Autism and Vaccines.” archive  Thiomersal isn’t the only ingredient in vaccines; they have admitted to traces of aluminum, which is classified as a neurotoxin to the body and stated that “despite using it for 90 years medical sciences’ understanding about using aluminum as a vaccine adjuvant is remarkably poor.”  In 2017, Activist Post reported a previous separate study that confirmed aluminum in vaccines may cause Autism Spectrum Disorder ASD, and children who suffer from it have up 10 times more metal in their brains than what is considered a safe amount for adults. Those researchers discovered that aluminum causes the membrane to separate the brain from blood flowing to it, thus affecting its internal temperature, non-neuronal cells and inflammatory cells.  Another previous study in 2012, from the peer-reviewed medical journal Lupus by Lucija Tomljenovic, PhD and Christopher A. Shaw, PhD of the University of British Columbia corroborates those claims , indicating that aluminum toxicity targets the mitochondria. That experiment found evidence that aluminum as an adjuvant can lead to permanent detrimental alterations of the brain and immune system function.  There are several additional court cases; although the CDC and pharmaceutical industry would love to have these covered up, I dug them up. One MMR clinical trial’s results were faked by Big Pharma Merck . Merck knowingly falsified its mumps vaccine test results to fabricate a “95% efficacy rate.” In order to do this, Merck “spiked the blood test with animal antibodies to artificially inflate the appearance of immune system antibodies,” as reported by CourthouseNews.com  In fact, regarding the use of aluminum and other metals in vaccines as an adjuvant, we may all be part of a 90-year-old experiment where we were all the lab rats.      American Natural Superfood - Free Sample Aluminum is an experimentally demonstrated neurotoxin and the most commonly used vaccine adjuvant. Despite almost 90 years of widespread use of aluminum adjuvants, medical science’s understanding about their mechanisms of action is still remarkably poor. There is also a concerning scarcity of data on toxicology and pharmacokinetics of these compounds. In spite of this, the notion that aluminum in vaccines is safe appears to be widely accepted. Experimental research, however, clearly shows that aluminum adjuvants have a potential to induce serious immunological disorders in humans. In particular, aluminum in adjuvant form carries a risk for autoimmunity, long-term brain inflammation and associated neurological complications and may thus have profound and widespread adverse health consequences. In our opinion, the possibility that vaccine benefits may have been overrated and the risk of potential adverse effects underestimated, has not been rigorously evaluated in the medical and scientific community. We hope that the present paper will provide a framework for a much needed and long overdue assessment of this highly contentious medical issue. – US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health  The MMR vaccine isn’t the only vaccine under scrutiny. In 2017, the Centers for Disease Control CDC announced there might be a link between miscarriages and vaccinations. The researchers found that women who had miscarriages between 2010 and 2012 were more likely to have had back-to-back annual flu shots including the Swine flu vaccine that a UK court ruled caused brain damage and Guillain-Barre syndrome GBS in multiple kids in 2015, as Natural Blaze reported.  At this point, the FDA effectively just inadvertently proved that jabbing yourself with a vaccine is the equivalent to trying Chinese research chemicals. Except that these chemical combinations are approved by the FDA. The question on everyone’s minds is, how wasn’t any of this identified long before any of these vaccines were ever approved for use by the masses? Especially, the Polio and Smallpox vaccines which have injured and killed many over the years.  Where at first the problem may have been metallics aluminum used in vaccines that the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health has admitted their understanding of aluminum as a main adjuvant in vaccines is “poor.” The new issue is vaccines that are made from living cells, or replicated cell substrates that may cause cancer or other serious diseases. Despite all this evidence, forced vaccinations are occurring in places like BC where, as Activist Post reported , parents have no choice but to vaccinate. As this writer previously wrote, vaccines affect individuals differently and can have adverse side effects; now parents need to worry about deadly cells hidden beneath the vaccines that can cause illnesses.  Is it ever really safe to put a foreign substance into your body when each person’s body functions differently and has a different chemical make up? As RFK, Jr. says when it comes to vaccines: “Let the evidence speak for itself.”  Steemit, SoMee, BitChute,  Aaron Kesel writes for Activist Post. Support us at Patreon .

My heart is so heavy 💔😔😭    Prayers for Beirut, Lebanon 🇱🇧pic.twitter.com/yAom0z9ZgG — StanceGrounded @_SJPeace_ August 4, 2020  VT: A general in the Lebanese Army reports that Israel dropped a tactical nuclear weapon on the port of Beirut today. He reports that this was done to collapse the current political regime there and revolt against Hezbollah. Their denial, almost identical to Israel’s supports this hypothesis. As the lies begin, nothing about this explosion, the mushroom cloud or the strength of the explosion is fireworks, which was the first lie, then ammonium nitrate fertilizer, they say under 3k tons, which was stored for years to use on Lebanon’s golf courses, when they decide to build them. No, nothing about today is funny. We also add that earlier today, Netanyahu’s statement which we believe is Israel taking credit for the attack. Beirut is still bomb damaged by Israel from 2006. How you take Netanyahu’s statements as outlined in Times of Israel today, is a matter of faith, trust or conjecture. نتنياهو قال اليوم بأن اسرائيل ستفعل”ما هو ضروريلحماية نفسها،تهديد لحزب الله- ما يفسر التفجيرات في #بيروت  Netanyahu said “will do what is necessary in order to defend ourselves”.

Terrorists involved in Urban Warfare in ME do not have access to these highly advance tactical weapons. If they have it now, then someone is equipping them for political gains. Let us wait for the official statements from Lebanon. I hope our friends from Beirut are safe. As per my latest source of information from Beirut. There is going to be a government cover up. The story about “Nitrate in the containers” is going to be declared as the original cause of the second massive explosion that caused the major damage. This will become the official narrative in the msm. I Was Bloodied and Dazed. Beirut Strangers Treated Me Like a Friend. https://t.co/gGlZAtlDeb — Barbara Davis @Natusb2 August 5, 2020 However, what influential and credible sources from Beirut are telling me is this:  “The Beirut explosion is about 100 times the energy than the 2015 Tianjin explosion, or 5.4 kilotons of TNT equivalent using linear extrapolation from Tianjin, which involved 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate. Conventional nukes against Japan had 15 to 21 kilotons. But this explosion is different, it is because of modern tactical nuke that contains up to 10 kilotons of the hybrid material including uranium. It is this reason why we still have acid and radiation in the air. The storage facilities near the grain elevator are NOT marked for hazardous material storage, but are instead marked for general cargo. Therefore, you can guess it, what we will be fed in the coming hours.” – Ghayet Ali ” First explosion was caused by Gabriel anti ship missile of Israel. The second explosion was caused by Israeli Delilah missile from F16. Our country is in complete jeopardy with this lazy and corrupt regime.”  Hezbollah, we are told, is expected to retaliate against Israel and they say there is no way for Syria not to be brought in.  Jeff Smith of the IAEA confirms this is a nuclear explosion. The lies about fireworks in ships and fertilizer are what we always get. You don’t store either one downtown in a major city like Beirut under any circumstances. Not much farming in Beirut and they don’t celebrate the 4th of July there.  The smoke could well be missile fuel which may mean a missile storage facility was hit by Israel. We have confirmation from Israel that they were planning to attack Beirut 5 days ago in retaliation for Hezbollah’s military attacks on Golan, which were not reported anywhere.  We are told Lebanon asked for nuclear investigators from Russia but there is no attempt to protect the site which, even if this were a modern clean weapon, still be radioactive.

RT has just covered the explosions and quotes a Lebanese govt. minister:  https://www.rt.com/news/497080-beirut-explosion-lebanon-videos/  Health Minister Hamad Hassan told local media that a ship carrying fireworks exploded in the port. Video footage lends weight to his explanation, as it shows a small explosion followed by the crackling of fireworks, before a second and massively destructive blast.  Local residents have shared images showing extensive damage to property. The office of the Daily Star newspaper was smashed by the blast, with windows blown out and furniture flung to the ground. France24 correspondent Leila Molana-Allen said that her apartment was “blown apart,” adding that she thinks the blast was caused by a “missile from a jet.”  It looks very much like the Lebanese have invented the ship full of fireworks story to cover the truth. Molana-Allen is almost certainly correct – that it was some kind of missile or guided bomb dropped by a jet fighter-bomber.  Or are they going with the one we have heard so many times before when tactical nukes have been used – that it was a store of explosives that went up:Of course they would deny it was an attack, no-one ever admits a nuke went off, it’s terribly bad for public opinion.  Sodium nitrate, basically a big fertiliser bomb, nope, not buying that at all, this is the cover story they appear to be going with.  Please pray for #Beirut , Lebanon.

c1dc1ac6,Obama’s Daughters Caught on Camera Burning US Flag at DC Protest,"In a show of anti-American sentiment that will surprise precisely no one, Sasha and Malia Obama were allegedly caught on camera burning a United States flag during a protest in Washington, DC. Kneeling across the street from the White House, they were seen wearing Black Lives Matter T-shirts and singing “Amazing Grace” while holding hands with other protestors.  But things took a turn for the worse when riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets into the crowd, all to clear the way for President Donald Jebediah Trump to waddle across the street for a photo op in front of a church he doesn’t attend, wave around a copy of a holy book he doesn’t read, and ramble like a psychotic dictator of a country he doesn’t love.  Sasha and Malia had come to the protest equipped with military-grade gas masks, so they were not overcome by the tear gas that crippled so many of their fellow protestors. They stood still in front of the advancing police, trying to give others a chance to escape the rubber bullets and tear gas.  As the police shoved their way through the peaceful crowd, an enraged officer ripped an American flag out of the hands of a group of high school students who were standing silently, holding the flag, and refusing to give up their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble.  Just then, recognizing the Obama daughters, the cop wadded up the flag, lit a corner of it on fire, waved to a news camera from OAN, and threw the burning flag at Sasha and Malia.  The Obamas, horrified to see a flag being burned, stretched it out between them to try to keep more of it from catching fire. That’s when the camera caught the image of them, holding a burning American flag.  Presidential historian Sandy Batt, who has always hated made-up stories about the Obama girls, rolled her eyes and said,  “Oh for god’s sake, people will really think they burned a U.S. flag,” when she was reached for comment.  Don’t be one of those people.",false

da01ca66,4 challenges await Panetta at DOD,"One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword, says the author. | AP photo 4 challenges await Panetta at DOD  Defense Secretary-designate Leon Panetta gained vast government experience as a reform-minded member of the House, where he chaired the Budget Committee. He later served in the White House as President Bill Clinton’s director of the Office of Management and Budget and then chief of staff. He aimed to put America’s financial accounts on a path to balance by the year 2000. He succeeded.  His integrity, lawyerly leadership, razor-sharp mind and affable demeanor will serve our nation, President Barack Obama and the Defense Department well.  Four major challenges await him at DoD:  • Address the wear and tear protracted warfare has exacted on our armed forces  The longest military engagements in U.S. history have achieved exemplary results at significant human cost. Multiple deployments, 5,885 deaths, thousands of permanent disabilities, inadequate dwell time, broken families, historic levels of suicide by soldiers and even family members and more than $2 trillion in treasure — all demand that our nation set firm timetables to complete the military mission and turn operations over to civilian control.  U.S. soldiers should not be expected to do nation-building. Ensuring success halfway around the world requires robust engagement of the world community — starting with neighboring nations whose backyards adjoin the undemocratic societies in which our soldiers bear the burden of order.  One cannot transfuse democracy at the tip of a sword. People in those societies should aspire to a better future for themselves — and be willing to sacrifice for it.  • Balance security concerns with budget realities    The need to cut war-induced federal deficits, both in the short term and long term, means that all spending must be on the table — including defense. It now makes up 20 percent of annual federal spending. Military leaders under Panetta must be resourceful, efficient and visionary to save dollars, while keeping our commitment to the troops and without compromising our national security.  The killing of Osama bin Laden is likely to further disrupt the capacity of Al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, allowing the U.S. to continue to withdraw forces from Iraq and begin an orderly drawdown from Afghanistan. Even so, the U.S. must maintain, as the Obama administration has pledged, a strong and agile military that is well trained and well equipped.  The new secretary recognizes the importance of hard power and soft power and understands that America must not only be militarily strong, but financially sound.  • Reining in the contractors    The increase in the use of contractors demands special scrutiny at the highest levels for three reasons:  a. Morale in the ranks  Insourcing military functions back to DoD is necessary — not just for prudent management of taxpayer dollars but morale in the ranks. When an E5 guard pilot, who enlisted at basic pay, sees contractors earning five times as much and operating by different rules of the road, there is a serious breakdown in the value set of service. Indeed the very meaning of military service changes from “duty” to “job.” Long term, this will corrupt the military code of honor and needs to be reined in now.  b. Security  Significant outsourcing of Pentagon duties to contractors increases the likelihood of security breaches. The military is aware this has even occurred in theater.  I can recall my shock at seeing signs posted in Iraq’s Green Zone: “No Alcohol on Base.” These were meant to curb contractor abuse. But what a poor message this sends to our regular forces. Military service should be exactly that – service to our nation, not one’s wallet.  c. Cost savings  Defense Secretary Robert Gates has left a goal of reducing service-support contractors by 10 percent each year for three years. Yet the FY 2012 budget seems to contradict this goal — since it contains funding to support growing contracted services. DoD proposes spending at least $87.6 billion next year on contracted services — $23.7 billion more than requested in FY 2011 and a 38 percent increase!  This increase in contractor spending flies in the face of a congressionally mandated inventory of contractors that the department has been derelict in providing. Hopefully, this is a lapse that Panetta can rectify early in his tenure.  Regaining U.S. energy independence  The Pentagon, as the largest petroleum user in the world, must lead our nation forward to energy independence. No challenge could be more vital to national security and economic security interests. High fuel costs are causing a hardship on American families, to be sure — but also on our service branches.  Even before the oil companies and Wall Street speculators drove up the price of gasoline close to $4 a gallon, the landed cost of a gallon delivered to the front lines for our troops in Afghanistan cost more than $400.  The Marines, the Navy and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus have been pacesetters among the service branches in developing alternatives to petroleum. Mabus told our subcommittee earlier this year, “Energy consumption in the Navy and Marine Corps has become a strategic vulnerability, an operational Achilles’ heel and a readiness challenge.”  The Navy and Marine Corps have set the goal to generate at least 50 percent of all the energy they use come from alternative sources no later than 2020. This is leadership. Panetta would be well served to expand this vision department-wide. Regaining U.S. energy independence is the national security issue of our time.  I look forward to working with Mr. Panetta and our subcommittee as we work together to put the Defense Department on a sustainable path to meet our nation’s vital needs in the 21st century.  Rep. Marcy Kaptur D-Ohio is on the Budget and Defense subcommittees of the House Appropriations Committee.",partially false
2ec747ae,Did China Steal Coronavirus From Canada And Weaponize It?,"Submitted by Great Game India  Last year a mysterious shipment was caught smuggling Coronavirus from Canada. It was traced to Chinese agents working at a Canadian lab. Subsequent investigation by GreatGameIndia linked the agents to Chinese Biological Warfare Program from where the virus is suspected to have leaked causing the Wuhan Coronavirus outbreak.  Coronavirus Bioweapon – How Chinese agents stole Coronavirus from Canada and weaponized it into a Bioweapon  The Saudi SARS Sample  On June 13, 2012 a 60-year-old Saudi man was admitted to a private hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, with a 7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration, and shortness of breath. He had no history of cardiopulmonary or renal disease, was receiving no long-term medications, and did not smoke.  Egyptian virologist Dr. Ali Mohamed Zaki isolated and identified a previously unknown coronavirus from his lungs. After routine diagnostics failed to identify the causative agent, Zaki contacted Ron Fouchier, a leading virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center EMC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, for advice.  Abnormalities on Chest Imaging of the Saudi patient infected with Coronavirus. Shown are chest radiographs of the patient on the day of admission Panel A and 2 days later Panel B and computed tomography CT 4 days after admission Panel C.  Fouchier sequenced the virus from a sample sent by Zaki. Fouchier used a broad-spectrum “pan-coronavirus” real-time polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR method to test for distinguishing features of a number of known coronaviruses known to infect humans.  This undated file image released by the British Health Protection Agency shows an electron microscope image of a coronavirus, part of a family of viruses that cause ailments including the common cold and SARS, which was first identified in the Middle East. HANDOUT/THE ASSOCIATED PRESS  This Coronavirus sample was acquired by Scientific Director Dr. Frank Plummer of Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory NML in Winnipeg directly from Fouchier, who received it from Zaki. This virus was reportedly stolen from the Canadian lab by Chinese agents.  The Canadian Lab  Coronavirus arrived at Canada’s NML Winnipeg facility on May 4, 2013 from the Dutch lab. The Canadian lab grew up stocks of the virus and used it to assess diagnostic tests being used in Canada. Winnipeg scientists worked to see which animal species can be infected with the new virus.  Research was done in conjunction with the Canadian Food Inspection Agency’s national lab, the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases which is housed in the same complex as the National Microbiology Laboratory.  The National Microbiology Lab The Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington St. in Winnipeg. Wayne Glowacki/Winnipeg Free Press Oct.22 2014  NML has a long history of offering comprehensive testing services for coronaviruses. It isolated and provided the first genome sequence of the SARS coronavirus and identified another coronavirus NL63 in 2004.  This Winnipeg based Canadian lab was targeted by Chinese agents in what could be termed as Biological Espionage.  Chinese Biological Espionage  In March 2019, in mysterious event a shipment of exceptionally virulent viruses from Canada’s NML ended up in China. The event caused a major scandal with Bio-warfare experts questioning why Canada was sending lethal viruses to China. Scientists from NML said the highly lethal viruses were a potential bio-weapon.  Following investigation, the incident was traced to Chinese agents working at NML. Four months later in July 2019, a group of Chinese virologists were forcibly dispatched from the Canadian National Microbiology Laboratory NML. The NML is Canada’s only level-4 facility and one of only a few in North America equipped to handle the world’s deadliest diseases, including Ebola, SARS, Coronavirus, etc.  Xiangguo Qiu – The Chinese Bio-Warfare Agent  The NML scientist who was escorted out of the Canadian lab along with her husband, another biologist, and members of her research team is believed to be a Chinese Bio-Warfare agent Xiangguo Qiu. Qiu was the head of the Vaccine Development and Antiviral Therapies Section in the Special Pathogens Program at Canada’s NML.  Xiangguo Qiu is an outstanding Chinese scientist born in Tianjin. She primarily received her medical doctor degree from Hebei Medical University in China in 1985 and came to Canada for graduate studies in 1996. Later on, she was affiliated with the Institute of Cell Biology and the Department of Pediatrics and Child Health of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, not engaged with studying pathogens.  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, the Chinese Biological Warfare Agent working at the National Microbiology Laboratory, Canada  But a shift took place, somehow. Since 2006, she has been studying powerful viruses in Canada’s NML. The viruses shipped from the NML to China were studied by her in 2014, for instance together with the viruses Machupo, Junin, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever and Hendra.  Infiltrating the Canadian Lab  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu is married to another Chinese scientist – Dr. Keding Cheng, also affiliated with the NML, specifically the “Science and Technology Core”. Dr. Cheng is primarily a bacteriologist who shifted to virology. The couple is responsible for infiltrating Canada’s NML with many Chinese agents as students from a range of Chinese scientific facilities directly tied to China’s Biological Warfare Program, namely:  Institute of Military Veterinary, Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Changchun Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Chengdu Military Region Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Hubei Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing  Sources say Xiangguo Qiu and her husband Keding Cheng were escorted from the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg on July 5, 2019. Since then, the University of Manitoba has ended their appointments, reassigned her graduate students, and cautioned staff, students and faculty about traveling to China. Governor General’s Innovation Awards  All of the above four mentioned Chinese Biological Warfare facilities collaborated with Dr. Xiangguo Qiu within the context of Ebola virus, the Institute of Military Veterinary joined a study on the Rift Valley fever virus too, while the Institute of Microbiology joined a study on Marburg virus. Noticeably, the drug used in the latter study – Favipiravir – has been earlier tested successfully by the Chinese Academy of Military Medical Sciences, with the designation JK-05 originally a Japanese patent registered in China already in 2006, against Ebola and additional viruses.  However, the studies by Dr. Qiu are considerably more advanced and apparently vital for the Chinese biological weapons development in case Coronavirus, Ebola, Nipah, Marburg or Rift Valley fever viruses are included therein.  The Canadian investigation is ongoing and questions remain whether previous shipments to China of other viruses or other essential preparations, took place from 2006 to 2018, one way or another.  Dr. Gary Kobinger, former chief of special pathogens right, and Dr. Xiangguo Qiu, research scientist second from right met with Dr. Kent Brantly and Dr. Linda Mobula, assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the physician who administered ZMapp to Brantly in Liberia when he was infected with Ebola during the 2014-16 outbreak. Submitted by Health Canada  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu also collaborated in 2018 with three scientists from the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, Maryland, studying post-exposure immunotherapy for two Ebola viruses and Marburg virus in monkeys; a study supported by the US Defense Threat Reduction Agency.  The Wuhan Coronavirus  Dr. Xiangguo Qiu made at least five trips over the school year 2017-18 to the above mentioned Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which was certified for BSL4 in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2017, the National Health Commission of China approved research activities involving Ebola, Nipah, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses at the Wuhan facility.  Coincidentally, the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located only 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market which is the epicenter of the Coronavirus outbreak dubbed the Wuhan Coronavirus.  The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is located just about 20 miles away from the Huanan Seafood Market, the epicenter of Coronavirus outbreak  The Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory is housed at the Chinese military facility Wuhan Institute of Virology linked to China’s Biological Warfare Program. It was the first ever lab in the country designed to meet biosafety-level-4 BSL-4 standards – the highest biohazard level, meaning that it would be qualified to handle the most dangerous pathogens.  In January 2018, the lab was operational ‘for global experiments on BSL-4 pathogens,’ wrote Guizhen Wu in the journal Biosafety and Health. ‘After a laboratory leak incident of SARS in 2004, the former Ministry of Health of China initiated the construction of preservation laboratories for high-level pathogens such as SARS, coronavirus, and pandemic influenza virus,’ wrote Guizhen Wu.  Coronavirus Bioweapon  The Wuhan institute has studied coronaviruses in the past, including the strain that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, H5N1 influenza virus, Japanese encephalitis, and dengue. Researchers at the institute also studied the germ that causes anthrax – a biological agent once developed in Russia.  “Coronaviruses particularly SARS have been studied in the institute and are probably held therein,” said Dany Shoham, a former Israeli military intelligence officer who has studied Chinese biowarfare. He said. “SARS is included within the Chinese BW program, at large, and is dealt with in several pertinent facilities.”  James Giordano, a neurology professor at Georgetown University and senior fellow in Biowarfare at the U.S. Special Operations Command, said China’s growing investment in bio-science, looser ethics around gene-editing and other cutting-edge technology and integration between government and academia raise the spectre of such pathogens being weaponized.  That could mean an offensive agent, or a modified germ let loose by proxies, for which only China has the treatment or vaccine. “This is not warfare, per se,” he said. “But what it’s doing is leveraging the capability to act as global saviour, which then creates various levels of macro and micro economic and bio-power dependencies.”  China’s Biological Warfare Program  In a 2015 academic paper, Shoham – of Bar-Ilan’s Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies – asserts that more than 40 Chinese facilities are involved in bio-weapon production.  China's Biological Warfare Program is believed to include full range of traditional chemical & biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles. #coronarovirus https://t.co/7qpDNNmqk7 — GreatGameIndia @GreatGameIndia January 25, 2020  China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences actually developed an Ebola drug – called JK-05 — but little has been divulged about it or the defence facility’s possession of the virus, prompting speculation its Ebola cells are part of China’s bio-warfare arsenal, Shoham told the National Post.  Ebola is classified as a “category A” bioterrorism agent by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning it could be easily transmitted from person to person, would result in high death rates and “might cause panic.” The CDC lists Nipah as a category C substance, a deadly emerging pathogen that could be engineered for mass dissemination.  China’s Biological Warfare Program is believed to be in an advanced stage that includes research and development, production and weaponization capabilities. Its current inventory is believed to include the full range of traditional chemical and biological agents with a wide variety of delivery systems including artillery rockets, aerial bombs, sprayers, and short-range ballistic missiles.  Weaponizing Biotech  China’s national strategy of military-civil fusion has highlighted biology as a priority, and the People’s Liberation Army could be at the forefront of expanding and exploiting this knowledge.  The PLA is pursuing military applications for biology and looking into promising intersections with other disciplines, including brain science, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence. Since 2016, the Central Military Commission has funded projects on military brain science, advanced biomimetic systems, biological and biomimetic materials, human performance enhancement, and “new concept” biotechnology.  In 2016, an AMMS doctoral researcher published a dissertation, “Research on the Evaluation of Human Performance Enhancement Technology,” which characterized CRISPR-Cas as one of three primary technologies that might boost troops’ combat effectiveness. The supporting research looked at the effectiveness of the drug Modafinil, which has applications in cognitive enhancement; and at transcranial magnetic stimulation, a type of brain stimulation, while also contending that the “great potential” of CRISPR-Cas as a “military deterrence technology in which China should “grasp the initiative” in development.  In 2016, the potential strategic value of genetic information led the Chinese government to launch the National Genebank, which intends to become the world’s largest repository of such data. It aims to “develop and utilize China’s valuable genetic resources, safeguard national security in bioinformatics, and enhance China’s capability to seize the strategic commanding heights” in the domain of Biotechnology Warfare.  Chinese military’s interest in biology as an emerging domain of warfare is guided by strategists who talk about potential “genetic weapons” and the possibility of a “bloodless victory.”",false
c69de08e,Number of people in poverty in working families hits record high,"The proportion of people living in poverty who are in a working family has hit a record high, according to a report that shows rising levels of employment have failed to translate into higher living standards.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty, about 56% of people living in poverty in 2018 were in a household where at least one person had a job, compared with 39% 20 years ago.  Seven in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family, the charity’s annual UK poverty report found.  Single-parent families have been the worst affected by the trend of wages falling behind living costs, it added. Working single parents accounted for three in 10 households in poverty in 2018, compared with two in 10 in 2011.  The JRF’s executive director, Claire Ainsley, said the charity’s latest barometer of poverty in the UK revealed the scale of the task facing Boris Johnson’s administration if it is to “level up” incomes across the UK by narrowing the gap between the wealthiest cities and poorer regions.  “The new government has a historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s,” she said. “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel, and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.”  Amid concerns that the poorest receive worse healthcare and have the most insecure jobs, Ainsley said it was an indictment of recent government policy that the number of people in poverty across the whole workforce jumped from 9.9% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2018.  Labour accused the government of allowing too many people to remain trapped in low-paid insecure work and “all too often the social security system fails to give people the support they need”.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs. Zero-hour contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  Approximately 14 million people are in poverty in the UK – more than one in five of the population, including 4 million children and 2 million pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  A family is classified as being in poverty if it has an income of less than 60% of the median income for their family type, after housing costs. A family’s income includes earnings from employment, self-employment, state benefits and inheritances.  The report said people were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  The worst-hit regions were London, the north of England, the Midlands and Wales, while the lowest poverty rates were found in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the JRF said.  The charity was especially concerned about the rise in young people living with their parents, who in a previous era would have started to buy a house and start a family of their own, which it named “concealed households”.  Twenty years ago, 20% 2.4 million of 20- to 34-year-olds lived with a parent or guardian. That proportion rose to 30% in 2018, affecting 3.9 million people, the JRF found.  The report describes in-work poverty as a “critical issue for our economy” and calls for action to reduce job insecurity, lower housing costs and increase earnings for low-paid workers.  The JRF said the introduction of universal credit, which rolls six benefits into one, did not help many low-income families because it required upfront payments for childcare before households were able to access state support.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We know that getting into work is the best route out of poverty – and there are more people in work than ever before. Wages are outstripping inflation and absolute poverty is lower than in 2010.  “We know that some need more help, which is why we spend over £95bn a year on working-age benefits. Millions will see their benefit payments rise further from April and we’re also boosting the incomes of pensioners each year through the triple lock.”",false
b8437efb,U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin,"U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin Stands Up for Wisconsin Dairy Farmers  Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act fights back against non-dairy products that are mislabeled as milk, yogurt and cheese  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin applaud the reform  WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin stood up for Wisconsin dairy farmers and introduced legislation today to combat the unfair practice of mislabeling non-dairy products. The Defending Against Imitations and Replacements of Yogurt, milk, and cheese to Promote Regular Intake of Dairy Everyday Act DAIRY PRIDE Act would require non-dairy products made from nuts, seeds, plants, and algae to no longer be mislabeled with dairy terms such as milk, yogurt or cheese.  “Dairy farmers in Wisconsin work tirelessly every day to ensure that their milk meets high standards for nutritional value and quality,” said Senator Baldwin. “Imitation products have gotten away with using dairy’s good name for their own benefit, which is against the law and must be enforced. Mislabeling of plant-based products as ‘milk’ hurts our dairy farmers. That’s why I’ve authored the DAIRY PRIDE Act to take a stand for Wisconsin farmers and the quality products they make.”  Dairy farmers and producers from across Wisconsin are strongly supporting Senator Baldwin’s reform:  “Finally after all these years, it’s about time someone stands up for the American Dairy farmer. We are held to higher quality and animal care standard every year to keep milk safe. It’s not fair that the name milk should be used by non-dairy drinks to further erode what little profit we have,” said Jerry Croes, member of the Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery in Deer Park, WI.  “As a proud Wisconsin Dairy Farmer, I support Tammy Baldwin’s efforts to introduce the DAIRY PRIDE Act. I know the economic struggles we dairy farmers face on a daily basis, as I am also an Ag Lender, helping through the low milk prices of 2015 and 2016. We don’t need competition from plant-based drinks being labeled as milk and sending a false message to consumers, and also falsely advertising them as being better than cow’s milk. When compared on nutrients and price, cow’s milk still comes out on top. I am opposed to all false labeling of food products that aren’t true dairy products,” said Jim Smidel of Brothers Smidel Farms, LLP in Kewaunee, WI.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, the increasingly common practice of labeling beverages as milk when they quite obviously are not is wrong and misleading. Senator Baldwin’s bill simply asks FDA to enforce current regulations meant to uphold the standards of identity, and integrity, of milk,” said Brad Nevin, Dairy farmer and member-owner of Associated Milk Producers Inc. AMPI in Rice Lake, WI.  “Consumers deserve to be treated with respect and that begins with proper and accurate food labels. Milk is clearly defined by the FDA, and this definition should also be enforced. It’s about time the FDA upheld its responsibility of enforcing existing labeling requirements, especially when it comes to dairy,” said John Rettler of Tin Valley Farms in Neosho, WI.    “Dairy has built a strong reputation as a reliable source of important nutrients we need daily. To use these dairy terms on plant-based products undermines the real value that dairy provides in the form of naturally occurring Calcium, Vitamin D, Vitamin A among others. Consumers associate dairy with the nutrients they need, and those are naturally occurring in milk from cows,” said Janet Clark of Vision Aire Farms in Eldorado, WI.  “Thank you, Senator Baldwin, for taking the initiative to protect the definition of milk, cheese and yogurt. Your advocacy supports the hard and honest work of dairy farmers in Wisconsin and throughout the nation, and more importantly, supports clear and accurate information to be shared on food labels, something consumers deserve,” said David Cooper, General Manager of FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative in Madison, WI.  “The FDA has already clearly defined milk, and liquid from a plant does not fit this definition. Existing regulation should be enforced, reserving the use of the term ‘milk’ exclusively for those products that deliver the nutritional value only found in dairy. We thank Senator Baldwin for her leadership on this matter,” said Mark Frederixon, Blair Division Manager of Associated Milk Producers Inc. AMPI in Blair, WI.  Dairy producer coalitions and groups around the country are also applauding the legislation:  “For too long, the FDA has turned a blind eye to the misbranding of imitation dairy products, despite the decades-old federal law that milk comes from animals, not vegetables or nuts. None of these imitators provides the same high quality and quantity of nutrition offered by real milk. Senator Baldwin’s DAIRY PRIDE Act will simply ensure that FDA enforces current law by requiring marketers of these imitation products to call them something other than milk,” said Jim Mulhern, President and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation.  “Dairy farmers invest a great deal of time and money to produce a wholesome, nutritious product for consumers, and take pride in the milk they produce. The federal government has promised to ensure that the term “milk” on store shelves can only be used on dairy products. But they have fallen short on that promise. The bill introduced by Senator Tammy Baldwin will help ensure that products labeled as milk are indeed dairy products. Consumers and dairy farmers alike will be the beneficiaries of this effort,” said Steve Etka of the Midwest Dairy Coalition.  The Wisconsin Dairy Products Association. which represents processors that manufacture a wide range of dairy products, supports Senator Baldwin’s legislation which protects the integrity and image of wholesome and nutritious dairy products, said Bradley Legreid, Executive Director of the Wisconsin Dairy Products Association.  Wisconsin Farmers Union fully supports the introduction and swift passage of the DAIRY PRIDE Act. Our grassroots, member-driven policy opposes any changes in the FDA definition of milk, cheese or other products made with milk and opposes the use of the word milk to designate any product not derived from mammals, Darin Von Ruden, President of the Wisconsin Farmers Union.  “National Farmers Union supports policy that encourages the healthy consumption of real dairy products and prevents the mislabeling of imitation and substitute dairy products in the marketplace. We appreciate Senator Baldwin’s leadership on the DAIRY PRIDE Act and her commitment to our nation’s dairy producers,” said Roger Johnson, President of the National Farmers Union.  “While imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, dairy imitators do not naturally provide the same level of nutrition as milk does,” said Michael Dykes, president and CEO of the International Dairy Foods Association. “We look forward to working with Senator Baldwin on this important legislation.”  “Cooperative Network strongly supports efforts to protect the integrity of dairy products by requiring national enforcement of the sensible labeling requirements we already have on the books. When misbranded items are corrected, we believe consumers will choose real dairy products over imitations, which will benefit Wisconsin’s vital $43 billion dollar dairy industry,” said Tom Liebe, President and CEO of the Cooperative Network.  “We applaud the efforts of Senator Baldwin to ensure that non-dairy foods are not inaccurately labeled as milk, cheese or yogurt. Our dairy farmers and processors work hard to produce incredible food. Milk and other real dairy products offer an almost unbeatable level and variety of nutrition. Mislabeling non-dairy foods confuses people buying these products and misleads them about the nutritional value of the items they purchase. It also hurts dairy farmers and related businesses. This bill is simply asking the FDA to adequately enforce the laws already on the books. It’s a small step that could have a very big positive impact,” said John Holevoet, Director of Government Affairs, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act is also supported by Bongards Creameries, Ellsworth Cooperative Creamery, First District Association, Dairy Business Association, Dairy Business Milk Marketing Cooperative, FarmFirst Dairy Cooperative, Mid-west Dairymen's Company and Scenic Central Milk Producers.  Current Food and Drug Administration FDA regulations define dairy products as being from dairy animals. Although existing federal regulation are clear, the FDA has not enforced these labeling regulations and the mislabeling of products as ‘milk’, ‘yogurt’ and ‘cheese’ has increased rapidly. This hurts dairy farmers that work tirelessly to ensure their Made in Wisconsin dairy products meet FDA standards and provide the public with nutritious food. It has also led to the proliferation of mislabeled alternative products that contain a range of ingredients and nutrients that are often not equivalent to the nutrition content of dairy products.  The DAIRY PRIDE Act would require the FDA to issue guidance for nationwide enforcement of mislabeled imitation dairy products within 90 days and require the FDA to report to Congress two years after enactment to hold the agency accountable for this update in their enforcement obligations.

43b52abb,Flu Vaccine Increases Coronavirus Risk 36% Says Military Study,"A recent military study shows military personnel evaluated who received the flu vaccine were at 36 percent increased risk for coronavirus with varied benefit in preventing some strains of the flu.  “Examining noninfluenza viruses specifically, the odds of both coronavirus and human metapneumovirus in vaccinated individuals were significantly higher when compared to unvaccinated individuals OR = 1.36 and 1.51, respectively Table 5.”  The flu vaccine studied demonstrated varied benefit in flu prevention – – some strains showed significant benefit while others did not.  Titled, Influenza vaccination and respiratory virus interference among Department of Defense personnel during the 2017–2018 influenza season, the report on the study addresses the phenomena of vaccine virus interference of the influenza vaccine.  Flu Vaccine Interference  Paraphrasing, the study highlights the value of the human body’s ability to fight against viruses. Apparently, by contracting influenza, the body naturally “may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses…”  Due to the flu vaccine’s “interference” with the naturally occurring biological process, there may be an increased risk of contracting non-influenza viruses:  “While influenza vaccination offers protection against influenza, natural influenza infection may reduce the risk of non-influenza respiratory viruses by providing temporary, non-specific immunity against these viruses. On the other hand, recently published studies have described the phenomenon of vaccine-associated virus interference; that is, vaccinated individuals may be at increased risk for other respiratory viruses because they do not receive the non-specific immunity associated with natural infection.”  Why This Topic?  I started digging into this topic on the Department of Veterans Affairs’ VA advice two weeks ago when I noticed the agency’s top advice about coronavirus was to “get a flu shot”.  This advice seemed a bit too simplistic when given to a population of largely elderly veterans with significant disabilities, vaccine histories, and exposures to various pathogens worldwide.  After writing about it, one reader sent an email citing this study in PubMed.  I was later provided a copy of the full study and reviewed it with an expert to verify my own conclusions based on the information in that report.  Informed Consent For Flu Vaccine  Now, the feedback I received that really caught my attention was mainly in a question: Is the heightened risk of coronavirus and other pathogens worth the benefit of the influenza vaccine based on this study as broken down in Table 5 above?  The column to focus on is “OR” in Table 5.  Coronavirus is 1.36 meaning 36% higher risk.  The influenza virus overall is 0.57 meaning the risk of contracting the flu was reduced overall. Three variants of flu did not receive a statistically significant reduction in risk.  Three of 8 evaluations noted a statistically insignificant benefit for the flu shot. Meanwhile, shot takers were at increased risk for coronavirus of 36%. I would bet $1 that this year, many Americans would likely rethink taking the vaccine with that bit of information.  If VA has this information, and they likely do, should the agency be required to share this increased risk factor with individuals considering the shot?  Studied Military Population  The study, published in the scientific journal Vaccine January 2020, was conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch Air Force Satellite at Wright-Patterson AFB, OH.  Taken at face value, the study indicates people who receive the flu vaccine are at increased risk for coronavirus pre-COVID-19. Like veterans, current service members, school teachers, and medical professionals, the study population consisted of a population with a history of being heavily vaccinated.  “The DoD provides a unique population for vaccination studies as mandatory vaccination against influenza is required by the DoD for all Active Duty and Reserve Component personnel. This study aims to examine the relationship between specific respiratory viruses and influenza vaccination. The protocol for this study was reviewed and approved as exempt by the Air Force Research Laboratory Institutional Review Board.”  Future § 1151 Claims For Malpractice?  Will veterans who contract the coronavirus after receipt of the flu vaccine based on VA’s top recommendation be eligible for § 1151 claims for malpractice?  How will the US Court of Claims – Vaccine Court handle an influx of US citizens injured by contracting the coronavirus due to the significant risk in the study?  Given that this report was published by DOD researchers in a scientific journal, why is VA telling veterans to get the influenza vaccine?  What is the motive behind their advice?  Veterans, and many disabled veterans, may be at higher risk of contracting coronavirus based on vaccine history alone. That is especially true for veterans who took the flu vaccine at the encouragement of VA doctors.  Who stands to gain with the current recommendation?  There are winners and losers with each of these decisions. The virus itself appears to more severely impact the elderly, of which the veteran population has many.  How about Vietnam veterans exposed to toxic herbicides?  This virus is basically a death sentence for our poorly treated disabled Vietnam veterans who rely on VA to provide safe and effective medical care for their diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc.  Ask Your Doctor  I encourage all readers to do your own research. Ask your VA medical doctor about this study and whether they agree with the blanket recommendation of the agency to get a flu shot to get ahead of coronavirus.  Is this solid medical advice?  For those interested, the study’s data came from the Department of Defense Global Respiratory Pathogen Surveillance Program DoDGRS is a DoD-wide program established by the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System GEIS.  The individuals included in the study provided respiratory specimens to the DoDGRS for 2017-2018 influenza season. Individuals who were sick prior to receipt of the flu vaccine were excluded from the study:  “All people submitting a respiratory specimen to the DoDGRS for the 2017–2018 influenza season were eligible for the study. The influenza season began 1 October 2017 and ended 29 September 2018. Those who submitted a sample and only tested positive for Chlamydia pneumoniae and/or Mycoplasma pneumoniae were excluded because these illnesses are bacteriological in nature, not viral. People with influenza and non-influenza coinfections were excluded because they could not be uniquely classified as either influenza or non-influenza respiratory virus. Individuals with multiple specimens collected during the season were also removed from the study as they could have had multiple different viruses over the season. Specimens where neither vaccination status could be obtained via databases nor a questionnaire was completed were excluded because vaccination status could not be confirmed. Subjects who were ill before receiving vaccination were excluded as vaccination status would therefore be unrelated to illness. Lastly, those people for whom the laboratory rejected the specimen were not included in the final study population.”  Be Optimistic But Careful  From what I can tell, the odds of being exposed in the US are high. The death rate if you get sick is high enough to warrant concern.  Wouldn’t it be nice to get good advice from the socialized healthcare system managed by the VA that is supposed to provide us with care?  For some non-US centric news about the virus, I wanted to include a YouTube video of 60 Minutes Australia about their perspective on the disease.  Now, this video pushes the narrative that the disease originated from the wet markets in Wuhan that also happened to be located near the level 4 biological laboratory studying the virus. I do not believe we know enough to confirm whether the origin is from such markets or manmade.  Getting Your Flu Shot?  I am personally not getting the flu shot and do not plan on taking any vaccines moving forward beyond what I was forced to take in the military due to vaccine injury.  What are your thoughts? Getting the flu shot to get ahead?",other

d72c2323,Kwik Trip Launches Kwik Strip Gentlemen’s Clubs,"LA CROSSE, WIS — Kwik Trip, Inc. has officially launched Kwik Strip, a new chain of convenience gentlemen’s clubs.  Opening statewide next week, the clubs seek to provide fast and convenient exotic entertainment in a familiar setting. The move marks a strategic business turn that aims to expand Kwik Trip’s existing portfolio and increase revenue across the board.  “We think there is an untapped market for folks who want to be able to gas up their cars, pick up a few essentials, grab that greeting card they forgot, and then get a quick lap dance from one of our coworkers, perhaps while enjoying a roller dog or nachos,” said Charles Winscomb, head of Kwik Strip sales and marketing.  “Plus, the name is recognizable as well as effective, like ‘Hey honey, I’m just gonna head to Kwik Strip, be right back.’ Did I say Kwik Trip? Strip? It all sounds similar, leaving a kind of gray area as to where exactly I’m going,” Winscomb added.  Company officials say there is a viable market for fast and convenient exotic entertainment and believe traditional gentlemen’s clubs and other forms of adult entertainment are outdated.  “Sneaking off to some questionable roadside club in the middle of nowhere at 1:30 A.M. on a Saturday night when your wife’s already in bed thinking you’re catching up on SNL is now a thing of the past. Not that I would know anything about that per se,” said Winscomb.  Kwik Strip will retain some popular Kwik Trip brands, but in a repurposed fashion.  Customer favorite The Hot Spot will no longer serve warm grab-and-go food items but instead serve as a location for private shows and lap dances by a performer named Karuba Gold.  Nature’s Touch, a familiar line of kitchen essentials, will be repackaged as Nature’s No-Touch Policy, which is standard practice in most gentlemen’s clubs.

Mixed with other suspected fraud, like 141,000 ballot drops at 6am the day after the election all the ballots in this state should be forensically audited to determine the full extent of the election fraud.  There was so much fraud in Michigan in the 2020 election it is difficult to know where to start. There were late-night ballot dumps in Michigan like other states:  There were vans delivering ballots in the early morning after the election under the Detroit TFC Center where votes were being counted:  TRENDING: REPORT: Nikki Haley Tried to Get a Meeting With Trump — But He Shot Her Down  Republicans were harassed and prevented from viewing the ballot counting in the same TFC center the next day. When finally some Republican observers forced their way into the room they found the poll workers counting Xerox copies of military ballots all for Biden:  The Washington Free Beacon now reports:  The Michigan secretary of state removed 177,000 inactive voters from the state’s voter rolls after settling a legal challenge. The stateremoved the names from the voter rolls in late January because the voters no longer live in the state or did not respond to the state’s inquiries about their addresses, according to a Tuesday district court announcement. The state performed the post-election audit during a legal battle with the Honest Elections Project, an election watchdog.  Michigan certified the election results in November claiming Joe Biden won by 154,000 votes.  Michigan’s 2020 election was run by crooks.

59960d0e,Police Stop Man From Dumping LSD Into L.A. Water Supply,"Police in Los Angeles have thwarted and apparent plot by a man to dump a whole bunch of hallucinogenic drugs into the city's water supply.  43-year-old Alexander S. Crow is a former chemist and used to work for Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He stands accused of trying to dump 251-NBOMe, a synthetic drug that mimics LSD, into the water supply. He's a member of a group called Psychedelic Rainbow Warrior Peace Force, which aims to promote the legalization of such drugs.  After Crow's arrest, many members of the group confirmed to the LAPD that Crow had often spoke about introducing LSD into the water supply. They just dismissed it as a delusional fantasy. “He’d ramble on for hours about ways to introduce hallucinogens into the water supply and how he wanted the Russian government to finance his plans, a spokesperson said. We just laughed it off as mad talk.”  Crow wanted to awaken the universal love with each of us by drugging the entire city.",false
2d0f41d8,Rep. David McKinley Calls for Increase in Border Patrol Agent Ranks,"WHEELING — At least $53 million a week in illegal drugs cross the Mexican border into the U.S. each week, and more border agents are needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to stop this, according to U.S. Rep. David B. McKinley.  McKinley, R-W.Va., recently traveled to the U.S.-Mexican border to learn about the issue there first hand. He visited the McAllen, Texas region in the Rio Grande District of the U.S. Border Patrol.  He commended the work of the border agents.  “They put themselves in danger and try to keep the border clean and secure. They’ve done that for decades,” McKinley said. “What has compounded this is the humanitarian crisis. We didn’t always have so many people trying to cross illegally.”  The agents attempt to still do their security job, put many are being pulled off the line to take care of the humanitarian crisis.  While at the border, McKinley learned a Mexican drug cartel controls happenings at the border.  He spoke with immigrants detained at the border who told him they paid the cartel anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 to get them across the border. Often, part of the deal is that the immigrant carry illegal drugs with them on the journey.  If the immigrants are captured, they are sent back to their village and must start over again and seek help from the cartel, McKinley said.  “One of the border officers said they the cartel might be making as much money on this as they are on drugs,” he said.  Border guards have a lot of tools to help track immigrants crossing into the U.S., even if they don’t have the manpower to stop all of them, according to McKinley.  The entire U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long, while the Rio Grande District agents focus on a specific 300-mile area. Sections of the Rio Grande River are narrow, and often the water is so low immigrants can walk across it. Border guards showed McKinley the footsteps in the mud where some had walked across the night before.  Where there isn’t a wall, cameras and sensors are placed to indicate when an immigrant is coming across the border.  But the cartel knows when agents could be as far as 10 miles away from a possible passage and unable to stop it. That’s when they help immigrants cross into the U.S., according to McKinley.  Nearly a million immigrants were stopped at the border before entering the U.S. last year, he said. Rio Grande District agents were responsible for 399,000 of the arrests, but they know from their technology they missed at least 47,000 immigrants in their crossing.  Many of these immigrants entering the U.S. carried opioids, according to McKinley.  “Border agents say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,” he said.  To compare, the state of West Virginia recently received $28 million for opioid rehabilitation, treatment and education.  “Almost twice that amount comes across the border each week — to put it into perspective,” McKinley said.",partially false

4461868e,Dem Senator Knope Caught With 8000 Mail-In Ballots,"If you still think mail-in ballots are a safe and secure way to go like the liberal media wants you to believe and that there’s never been any evidence of widespread voter fraud, it’s time for a rude awakening. Indiana’s freshman Senator Leslie Knope was busted yesterday at the Joe Biden fundraising headquarters located in the town of Pawnee with over 8000 pre-marked ballots, just waiting to be sent.  According to libertarian watchdog official and red meat activist Ron Swanson, the blame lies on a confluence of events within the entire department. The ballots, he says, were delivered last week by Joe Barron Movers, and were intended for filing properly with the division of elections. However, a state employee, identified only as “Jerry” mistakenly signed for the drop off, and assumed they were more “busy work” he’d been assigned to cover for intern April Ludgate, who absolutely hates doing anything involving the names of human beings.  Department head and lead vocalist for rock ensemble “Mouse Rat”, Andy Dwyer, related his view of the catastrophe to the Pawnee Gazette’s Perd Hapley, who often writes for the Pawnee Gazette.  “Okay, so when all those boxes came in, I naturally thought: ‘Wow! Someone’s moving in!’ But it turned out they weren’t moving boxes. They were boxes of paper, which i think is a great idea, because if you put papers in bags, you have to iron them before you can make them into airplanes. Anyway. If I really have to be frank with you, or even beans with you, I kind of missed what happened next because I had to help Ann with her car. I don’t really know much about cars, really, but it wouldn’t start, so I figured it just needed start juice. Which for cars is called ‘gas’. Which, strangely doesn’t go in the keyhole where you’d think start juice would go. Okay. Can I keep this chair?”  Despite the initial controversy, Knope has apologized for what appears to be a simple misunderstanding. It’s a very confusing job to do, when you always have to worry about what those jerks in Eagleton are up to just miles away.",false
213a870b,Smoking Gun! Joe Biden’s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm,"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.  Keep up to date with our latest:  An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.  Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power!  Going into effect Sunday, Feb. 14, Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.  The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.”  Days later, the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9,000/MWh.  The EO shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards, while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.

e2e93a55,Shell Corporation That Legally Owns Epstein’s Island Traced To the Clinton Foundation,"An undercover investigation into the actual deeded owners of Jeffrey Epstein’s private island has uncovered some shocking insight into who was responsible for covering up all the heinous crimes over the years.  That investigation has uncovered a shell company that can be traced back to none other than the Clinton Foundation.  The foundation, which has been known to run as many as a dozen smuggling ships for drugs, arms, and human trafficking in the past, was apparently using Epstein Island as a home base, safe from US laws and slavery regulations.  According to sealed records that may or may not be available to the public, the company is called “Foster Chelsea International” and is supposedly in the business of providing safe homes for lost, stolen, or misplaced children across the globe.  It wasn’t until the source found the owner of that company to be a man he recognized as Roger Clinton, pictured having dinner with Nancy Pelosi and her nephew Gavin Newsome, surfaced in a surveillance photo from a casino on tribal lands in New Mexico.  Some skeptics say that information just doesn’t seem relevant, but that’s because they’ve been brainwashed by the MSM to purposely miss the point of stuff.  With this new information, Trump can use his last month in office to send the navy to find their new secret hideout, root out their commanders, and blow their fleet to kingdom come.  There’s a rumor that after Epstein didn’t kill himself, the company moved its secret black ops to an even more secret location that only six people know about, on a remote island 4.7 miles south by southeast of Guam.  We’ll keep you updated with any new information on the election and how Guam may have interfered whenever possible.  God bless you, patriot, and God bless America. Amen.",false
1f33d253,Northern Ireland legally allows abortions for rape and incest victims,"Pro-choice protesters chant slogans at a protest Picture: PA  Victims of rape and incest will now be legally allowed to carry out abortions in Northern Ireland after a landmark legal challenge to relax the country’s strict laws proved successful.  Before the challenge, Northern Ireland was the only UK country that didn’t take up the 1967 Abortion Act – meaning that terminations were only legally permitted in instances where the life or mental health of the mother was in danger.  Anyone who performed an illegal termination faced the prospect of life imprisonment in jail.  But a challenge to the legal ruling was brought in July by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commision NIHRC – who wanted to legalise terminations in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormality.  MORE : BREAKING NEWS: 75% of Labour members ‘oppose Islamic State strikes in Syria’  Advertisement  Advertisement  MORE : Advertising junk food before 9pm could be banned in a bid to tackle obesity  And while a law change was recommended in circumstances of fatal foetal abnormality, the NIHRC argued that this was not enough – and said that the current law was incompatible with human rights legislation regarding inhuman and degrading treatment.  Delivering the latest breakthrough ruling, Judge Mr Justice Mark Horner told Belfast High Court: ‘In the circumstances, given this issue is unlikely to be grasped by the legislature in the foreseeable future; I conclude that the Article Eight [of the European Convention on Human Rights] rights of women in Northern Ireland who are pregnant with foetal abnormalities or as a result of sexual crime are breached by the impugned provisions.’  The judge also claimed that current Northern Irish law placed a ‘disproportionate’ burden on the victims of sexual crime.

7c9af097,Scientist Explains Why He Believes Aluminum Is “Almost Certainly” Playing A Role in Autism,"In Brief The Facts: It is alleged by many in the spiritual community that something called 'THE EVENT' will play out that will either bring about a great awakening and the end of an era of struggle and captivity for humanity.  Reflect On: Why do we always hear of events that involve humanity sitting around and waiting for something? Why is it that we never have to take responsibility for our part in something? We are here, not to wait for a saviour, but to take action within the self.  You probably have been hearing about ‘The Event’, in articles, vlogs and conversation. All around the internet are preparing people for what some are calling the ascension event that will suddenly wake everyone up and end all of the cabal behavior on the planet.  There’s a lot to say about this, and a lot of helpful info we can consider to bring ourselves to a point of understanding as well as practicality, i.e. what we can do. My intention here isn’t to burst any bubbles about this, but to bring us back to an authentic place within ourselves and also back to our intuition.  One final thing, over the course of the past 10 years I’ve not shared much about where I get my info, what I’ve been tapped into since I was younger, the practices I use and how I’ve practiced to truly develop some of these skills. I’ve kept more quiet because I personally like to fly under the radar; simply be myself, remain quiet and live the change and my truth. I don’t believe in having to be loud about our abilities to convince others of who we are. Tapping into intuition, having a strong connection 24 hours a day to my higher self, hearing beings, ‘downloading’ or visually seeing and connecting with peoples lives, getting consistent info downloads etc, these are all a natural part of my life but it’s not something that makes me or anyone else special. It’s simply part of developing it. Some of us may start with different ‘abilities’ more activated, but we can always develop things. CE wasn’t built the way it was simply by using my mind to figure things out, it took diligent conscious practice and intuition to know what was most serving for humanity and when. To take complex conscious ideas and make them reach a mass audience and create virality.  I share this because, we seem to be at a time where confusion is high, disinformation is even higher, and many of us aren’t truly practicing the information we are hearing about or learning. So I share this as what I’m about to convey below is important and I don’t wish to reduce the content to simply ‘I’ve done research,’ these truths come from deeper places. The same places you can access through heart based living and a solid connection to your higher self.  I believe we need to ‘cut the crap’ when it comes to all the identification with “I’m an intuitive,” “I’m an empath,” “I’m a channeller” etc, and realize we all have those abilities within us if we choose to awaken by practice. It’s time for true empowerment 🙂  What Has Been Said About ‘The Event’  First let’s begin with what’s being said. It is being called a breakthrough for the planet that will cause a number of different unfoldments. Some say the defeat and arrest of the cabal, resetting of financial systems, disclosure of ET’s, aliens coming to the planet, revelation of new and advanced technologies, new governments and political systems etc.  It’s being claimed that on the non physical plane: there will be a “big wave or flash of energy and light coming from the Galactic Central sun going towards the surface of the planet”. The galactic central sun is an object in the Sagittarius constellation. The energy from the Central Sun will stimulate a flash or special kind of light from the Sun that permeates the earth and humanity, raising the frequencies of all living entities on the planet.  It is said that it will not be a major negative event but one that is positive. Some are even suggesting to prepare with several weeks of food and supplies as it may knock out our current infrastructures. It’s also being said that this wave of energy will be soooo powerful that it will literally fry people’s brains and make them go crazy.  I have a lot to say about all of this.  First, A Note On Channeling  From what I have gathered, most people are learning ‘channeling’ information about this from various sources or beings out there. This of course is a real thing and completely possible, but there are caveats that we often don’t consider. I’ve experienced some very good, very talented channellers who are tapped right in to authentic stuff, then again I’ve also seen the opposite.  In a lot of ways I have always steered people away from channeling. Mainly because it takes a level of mastery to truly understand and feel out what one is tapping into. Not only that, much of the time the information you can get from your higher self is more than enough to keep you rolling, and it has nothing to do with channeling. Your connection to your higher self is constant if you practice. The desire to jump deep into channeling can sometimes come from an egoic desire to want to see the future, know the future or even in some ways.. have a ‘super power’ of sorts. I’m not saying there is anything wrong with this, but more so that this can be what pushes us to want it. Like I said above, of course there are many authentic channellers out there as well.  Over the 10 years I have been exploring and observing different channellers, I’ve noticed a lot of the same thing. Repeating the same stuff over and over again, repeating vague and often obvious things, noticing that the channelled info is simply coming from the mind of the channeller and not actually from another being or source etc. From a personal point of view, my message has always been about going within, instead of focusing so much attention on getting information like this from outside ourselves.  From a listener point of view, there is general curiosity which is a beautiful thing, but sometimes we also start jumping into the idea of wanting to know what’s going to happen, being aware of the future and what’s coming… so as to control things or be able to prepare. This can be helpful at times, but it can also be a source of getting us stuck or limited. It also resembles a faith based, religious-like mentality where we take word of what is to come, and then act on that, without ever checking how we feel inside. The way I’ve practiced over the years is, my primary source 85% – 90% of where I get my information like this is from my own self or higher self, my secondary source would be corroborating information with various sources out there like other people, channellers, intuitives etc etc. I feel this is a more ideal course of action as it asks YOU to develop your own knowing and connection with & to your higher self. This is part of an authentic path towards shifting consciousness when we take action and make the necessary changes from within.  The Reality Of What’s Happening  I made a film several years ago called The Collective Evolution III: The Shift. It is all about the shift in consciousness taking place, what’s going on and where humanity is headed. It’s presented in a way that can be passed across any group; those that view things through science, spirituality or who are on the fence. The purpose of the film was to bring these understandings to a grounded and practical space, where much of the human experience exists at this time. In the film, I go into great detail about the cosmic ray portion of the shift, which much of The Event refers to. I’d recommend watching the film for further understanding, but will also elaborate below.  The shift we’re experiencing is ongoing. MANY waves have already hit our planet and are still coming. This has been happening for years and it is PART of what is causing so many of the changes we are seeing today. Shifts in the way people think, shifts in how our world works, insurgence of equality, the calls for changes in our financial systems, political systems and so forth.  These waves have been happening for decades and have been intensifying as we go. They are made up of cosmic bursts from our sun, the galactic sun, surrounding stars and so forth. All cosmic waves carry unique energies with unique signatures and information. This information carries the ability to evolve thought, ideas, DNA, change energy signatures and so forth. But it’s also important to note that this energy has be ‘throttled’ in a sense, through our agreement, and for good reason. More on this in a second.  THE EVENT is following the same path as many other claims like this. It makes this shift in consciousness about ONE thing, ONE moment and so forth. Much like we did with 2012.  Many claim “nothing happened in 2012” because they were looking for something physical and were looking for something HUGE to happen. Yet energies did in fact shift in big ways in and around the 2012 dates many were talking about. But they also shifted in ways prior to that, and after that as well. This shift is a process and one that will continue to unfold over time little by little. Yes many of us are wearing a bit thin as this intensifies, but this simply means we have work to do and it might be harsh to accept but if I’ve witnessed a prominent practice in the overall spiritual movement it’s not practicing what we preach. “I know that information already!” But are you doing it?  Continuing on here, yes, bigger events will continue to take place and mass ‘traumas’ will be experienced as we are challenged with big time change, but we won’t bite off more than we can chew. I say traumas to describe what will feel like very tough times for many people as we realize, en masse, things like the existence of a cabal, how we’ve been systematically manipulated our entire lives, our spiritual connection hindered on purpose etc. This will be tough until we work through it all. Hence traumatic feelings.  Humanity often feels like we are victim to things we experience. Energies, beings, events happening, other people etc, but we choose and agree to things and take them on as we are ready for them. This doesn’t mean that being ready for it won’t cause some pain, the idea isn’t avoiding pain. With pain we often get growth. Suffering comes when we choose to ignore the growth that can be presented to us through pain.  I know that idea doesn’t sit well with some of us but ask the question, where does sitting with pain and holding onto it forever lead us? Even from a logical perspective, the answer is to work past it and grow from it, as lingering only creates more suffering.  It has been 10 years since I founded Collective Evolution and began working in the consciousness space. During that time I have created a conscious media and education company CE, 4 films in the consciousness space and have met many spiritual teachers from around the world for interviews, as friends and so forth. I also have diligently practiced exploring consciousness through sober means, developing my intuition and so forth. In my courses I spread the message of authentic change from within that is built around truly shifting your consciousness so your connection to self and your way of being is automatic, not built on acting from belief systems.  From this space I share simply that the overwhelming feeling points to the fact that humanity is on a journey, one that may be slow at times, but challenges US to be the ones that take action. We must take action from within to shift ourselves; it’s through that space within ourselves that we begin to take action to shift our external world.  Much like we see when we do EVERYTHING for someone and never challenge them to do their own work and suddenly they don’t quite learn and aren’t empowered in their own way, we are on that journey with the shift we face personally as well. Although it’s tempting to view a single event as something that will come in and do the bulk of the work for us, this isn’t going to happen simply because it doesn’t serve us. This is a gradual process.  We’re here to do the work within ourselves. Yes, energies will come in and assist with that process as the sun and central sun act as a purveyors of evolution, but it’s also up to us. Beings are already watching and assisting closely in slowing down many of the energies coming in due to the fact that they are a bit too intense for our consciousness at the moment. This is primarily because many of us aren’t actually practicing what we are learning. We read books, learn about things and then go on living in the same old ways. We don’t shift our diets, we don’t practice meditation or presence, we don’t disempower the ego and we don’t live from our hearts, even though we know this will lead us to a thriving world.  Partly this happens because our current world is intense. There is a lot of work being done to keep us stuck, keep us distracted and so forth. But this is simply presented as an added challenge, to help build our strength within ourselves. We CAN DO IT, otherwise we wouldn’t have bit off this much. Remember that.  Don’t Wait, It’s Now  More than waiting or focusing on a single event, look at what we have right here, right now – in our world and within ourselves. This is truly all we have to focus on, and as you have intuitive feelings towards other things, follow them. But remember to not get fixated on events, dates and promises that claim to come in and take care of everything for us. NOW is most important. Our financial systems, political systems, technologies and so forth will shift and evolve as we do.. it’s not one before the other. Remember quantum physics? We determine our external reality based on how our consciousness projects our world. How do we project a thriving world if we don’t do the internal work first to shift our consciousness? Our outside world simply reflects us. For it to shift, we must do so first.  Are you doing what you love in your life and living from a space where you follow your hearts desires? Are you practicing the observation of the ego and continually shifting from egoic consciousness to heart based living? Are you practicing meditation to reduce over-thinking and more presence? Are you treating others in a way you would want to be treated.. as much as you can, not just sometimes? Are you choosing to empathize and understand where people are at and why vs judging them and calling them names?  All of these things are ways to move towards living in the heart. It’s about going from the mind, to the heart.  Some Key Reflections  When it comes to beings/aliens, remember that in many ways they are just souls having an experience and they may or may not have had experiences as humans. Their advice sometimes may be missing some key details on what it means to be human.  Beings are not ‘above us’. Aliens are not ‘above us.’ We don’t need to bring the mentality in that humans are some primitive culture, as this brings about judgement most of the time. We are all just having experiences, and in many ways we teach things to these other beings just as they teach us.  What can you do right now to practice living in your heart and make that a daily state of being?  Getting or hearing information from outside of yourself is great, and it’s part of how we use one another to learn. Are you checking within yourself about whether or not things are true? How does it feel for you when you know it’s true?",false
0f086930,Flynn campaign: Statement on Walker campaign announcement,"CONTACT: Bryan Kennedy, 414 517-3864  Milwaukee — Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Matt Flynn today made the following statement criticizing Scott Walker for his failed economic policies, as Walker prepares to announce his campaign for re-election tomorrow.  “Scott Walker’s time is up. Average wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower today than they were under Jim Doyle. For the first time in decades, Wisconsin has fallen behind the rest of the country in terms of economic growth.  “Walker depressed Wisconsin wages by passing Act 10, Right To Work, and the repeal of the prevailing wage. Everybody is working for less, union or non-union, public sector or private sector. Less money in workers’ pockets means less consumer spending, and less economic growth.  “Walker also refused to accept the very tax dollars Wisconsinites sent to the federal government, including upwards of $500 million for BadgerCare and over $800 million for trains. Instead, he is making taxpayers invest $3 billion in a Chinese company, said they didn’t need to follow the same environmental laws Miller Brewing and Harley Davidson follow, and is pushing it through his corrupt Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation without the public ever seeing the contract.  “When Walker says Wisconsin is ‘open for business’ it means his integrity and campaign coffers are open for business. And while it’s been very good for his fundraising operations, his record has been a nonstop disaster for Wisconsin families. For the right-wing views of his party, he has sacrificed our state.  “The most important issue in this race is improving wages for Wisconsin workers. Scott Walker has been governor for nearly eight years now, and he’s looking to extend it to twelve. We all know he’s just sitting there as he makes plans for his own future. Instead, it’s time to elect a governor who will focus on what really matters, creating economic activity that drives wages up again.”",partially false

Following a similar decision last week, where Biden canceled events for four straight days leading up to the final presidential debate, it doesn’t paint a picture of a dedicated and able leader.”  The Trump campaign account had a little fun with the announcement.  15 days before Election Day and Joe Biden has officially called a lid for the day!pic.twitter.com/3aanThwYVE — Team Trump Text VOTE to 88022 @TeamTrump October 19, 2020  Word is that former President Barack Obama will be doing some appearances for Biden, possibly, after drawing an audience of approximately 80 people in Miami Florida this past weekend.  American Greatness wrote about Obama and said:  “Moreover, Biden’s son, Hunter, has given “the big guy” the added problems of an abandoned laptop and a disgruntled former business partner. These matters could prove that the Biden family members, including “the big guy,” have peddled influence for a pretty penny to America’s enemies. Or so rumor has it, since the elitist leftist media refuses to mention the matter, calling it “Russian disinformation,” “hacking,” a “distraction” and, indeed, anything but what it is—authentic evidence of corruption. Still, if the rotten Biden family tree falls in the forest and the media covers it—with a blanket—will it make a sound? They are counting on a “no” answer to that question.

Sadly, our corrupt politicians and mainstream media only relate the bad news.  If you do not have any respiratory symptoms, such as fever, cough, or runny nose, you do not need to wear a medical mask.

Now, as the number of deaths has surpassed 400,000 in the US, Dr. Jensen and lawmakers are calling for an audit of these deaths.  in the US they get $12,000 to $13,000 for patients admitted and testing positive for a COVID-19 diagnoses and another $39,000 again give or take, for those put on ventilators. Those number vary a bit from report to report.  If they have 161 covid patients, they get an extra $70,000 per patient. That one I just found out about via the video. Thank you Dr. Jensen. There should be an audit of deaths world wide, as death certificates were also changed in other countries as well.

By December, eighteen students in the district had taken their own lives; an early-warning mental health system embedded within computers and tablets issued to students for remote learning received 3,100 alerts since schools shuttered their doors last March.  “When we started to see the uptick in children taking their lives, we knew it wasn’t just the Covid numbers we need to look at anymore,” said Jesus Jara, the Clark County superintendent.  “We have to find a way to put our hands on our kids, to see them, to look at them. They’ve got to start seeing some movement, some hope,” Jara said.  Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across the country have led to drastic changes in the way children and teens learn and socialize.  Government data show a 24% increase in the number of children who arrived in emergency departments with mental health issues from mid-March through mid-October, compared with the same period in 2019.  Countrywide, tens of millions of students have been thrown into a new distance learning environment that has resulted in many extracurricular activities being canceled. Recreational spaces have closed, sports canceled, and playdates shifted to Zoom calls, resulting in many kids developing mental issues, especially in Clark County.  Clark County administrators had GoGuardian Beacon alert system installed on every device given out to students after the sixth student suicide last year. The system alerted administrators of more than 3,100 cases where a student searched suicide-related material between June and October.  In one instance, a 12-year boy searched “how to make a noose” on his iPad.” Administrators quickly reached out to the boy’s parents as he was about to hang himself.  The alerts have been so disturbing to Jara that he doesn’t sleep near his phone anymore.  “I can’t get these alerts anymore,” said Jara. “I have no words to say to these families anymore. I believe in God, but I can’t help but wonder: Am I doing everything possible to open our schools?”  Dr. Anthony Fauci has called for schools on a countrywide basis to reopen safely.  An indirect consequence of the pandemic and forcing children to learn at home has contributed to a rise of mental health issues and suicides among America’s future generation.

In order to stem any conflicts resulting from disagreements among “politically charged” attendees, the organization is effectively banning the wearing of certain articles of clothing bearing political symbols or slogans, including the popular red “Make America Great Again” cap favored by fans of *President Donald Trump.  The announcement broke early on Sunday, spreading across social media, mostly finding anger and consternation in Facebook groups and pages for conservative mental patients who support the morbidly obese failure like Russian prostitutes laughing while they’re being urinated on. Many of the waddling old chimp-humpers have proposed arguing to security personnel that the caps are medical necessities, prescribed to keep the wearer’s brain from escaping through the ear canals. Others intend to boycott the organization, potentially costing them tens of dollars of lost revenue.  Joe Barron, head of Barron’s Best Beer, NASCAR’s largest sponsor, spoke briefly to the Speedqueef Gazette about his concerns with the policy.  “So no more dickhead hats on the MAGA tards? Okay.

c5175d8d,Scott Walker still owes $1 million for presidential campaign,"Gov. Scott Walker said Friday his presidential campaign remains $1 million in the red, despite a spurt of fundraising in the final quarter of 2015. Credit: Associated Press  By of the  Madison— Scott Walker's former presidential campaign still owes more than $1 million, despite raising $500,000 in the last three months of 2015.  Also Friday, the Republican governor said he's dropping the practice his political operations adopted last year of paying for the travel costs to campaign events for Walker's state security team. Taxpayers will now, as they did before the presidential campaign, foot the costs of both the travel and salaries of the governor's security when he leaves the state for political events.  As of the end of last year, Walker's White House campaign had about $1.2 million in obligations left and about $153,000 in cash that partially offsets those debts.  Though Walker has raised nearly $8 million for his short run, his operation spent the cash faster than he could raise it over the campaign's 71-day life, and he dropped out of the 2016 presidential race in September.  A report filed Friday with federal elections officials shows the resulting burden won't be an easy one, even for the best political fundraiser in state history.  Governor Walker made substantial progress in addressing financial commitments over the last quarter, and he remains humbled by the outpouring of support from friends across the country who continue to believe in his common sense reform agenda, spokesman Joe Fadness said.  The filings show Walker still owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to a number of companies, including fundraising and communications consultants, direct mail companies, and photographers and video producers.  His highest debts include: $317,000 to FLS Connect LLC, a Minnesota-based telemarketing company; $82,000 to a Washington, D.C.-based legal consulting company, Jones Day; $70,000 to SCM Associates, a New Hampshire based direct mail printing company; $59,000 to the Lukens Co., an Arlington-based direct mail printing company; $44,000 in event staging expenses to MMA Events, a Maryland-based company; and $39,000 to an Alexandria-based video production company, Sharp Politics.  Walker also got some help from his state campaign committee, Friends of Scott Walker, which purchased $14,682 of items from the presidential campaign.  And he rented his voter list to Voter Gravity Inc., and Granite Lists LLC, for $20,000 and $15,700.70, respectively.  The governor did make some progress paying off his debts in the wake of his failed presidential bid.  He had owed about $10,500 to the Waukesha County Expo Center, where he officially launched his 2016 campaign in July, but paid that bill in full.  Walker also refunded 152 contributions for a total of $407,546.24.  Walker's presidential campaign took in $2.4 million and $1.2 million during July and August. Those figures dropped off dramatically in September, with $484,521, and October, with $35,279. The campaign still managed to break six figures in individual contributions in November and December, bringing in $127,498 and $151,334, respectively.  Also Friday, Walker's affiliated Unintimidated PAC reported that it took in $3.7 million in itemized receipts in the last half of 2015. The grand majority of that money came from two families: Richard and Elizabeth Uihlein contributed $2.5 million; and Mary and Mike Shannon of Milwaukee contributed another $500,000. Richard Uihlein is CEO of Pleasant Prairie-based Uline Corp. Mike Shannon is the CEO of KSL Capital Partners.  The PAC filed termination papers Friday.  State officials also said Friday that in the future, Walker's political operations will no longer reimburse state taxpayers for his security team's travel expenses.  Walker's political operations have reimbursed state taxpayers $260,000 to cover hotel stays, airfare and other travel expenses last year for his security team. But in the future, taxpayers will have to pay such costs when state troopers accompany Walker on political trips, said Jim Dick, a spokesman for the state Department of Administration.  Walker decided last year to have his political operations pick up some of those costs while he crisscrossed the country and traveled overseas as he explored and launched his presidential campaign.  But Walker is returning to the previous practice as used by other governors of both parties. Democrat Jim Doyle, for instance, brought security along on his travels to political and other events, such as a December 2010 visit to Cancun for a United Nation climate change conference.  The Wisconsin governor was an early favorite in the Republican field after surging in the wake of a January 2015 speech in Iowa, but then began to flounder as real estate mogul Donald Trump surged and Walker had to clarify statements about birthright citizenship and building a wall on Canada's border.

58b61315,Fauci knew about HCQ in 2005 -- nobody needed to die,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, whose “expert” advice to President Trump has resulted in the complete shutdown of the greatest economic engine in world history, has known since 2005 that chloroquine is an effective inhibitor of coronaviruses.  How did he know this? Because of research done by the National Institutes of Health, of which he is the director. In connection with the SARS outbreak - caused by a coronavirus dubbed SARS- CoV - the NIH researched chloroquine and concluded that it was effective at stopping the SARS coronavirus in its tracks. The COVID-19 bug is likewise a coronavirus, labeled SARS-CoV-2. While not exactly the same virus as SARS-CoV-1, it is genetically related to it, and shares 79% of its genome, as the name SARS-CoV-2 implies. They both use the same host cell receptor, which is what viruses use to gain entry to the cell and infect the victim.  The Virology Journal - the official publication of Dr. Fauci’s National Institutes of Health - published what is now a blockbuster article on August 22, 2005, under the heading - get ready for this - “Chloroquine is a potent inhibitor of SARS coronavirus infection and spread.” Emphasis mine throughout. Write the researchers, “We report...that chloroquine has strong antiviral effects on SARS-CoV infection of primate cells. These inhibitory effects are observed when the cells are treated with the drug either before or after exposure to the virus, suggesting both prophylactic and therapeutic advantage.”  This means, of course, that Dr. Fauci pictured at right has known for 15 years that chloroquine and it’s even milder derivative hydroxychloroquine HCQ will not only treat a current case of coronavirus “therapeutic” but prevent future cases “prophylactic”. So HCQ functions as both a cure and a vaccine. In other words, it’s a wonder drug for coronavirus. Said Dr. Fauci’s NIH in 2005, “concentrations of 10 μM completely abolished SARS-CoV infection.” Fauci’s researchers add, “chloroquine can effectively reduce the establishment of infection and spread of SARS-CoV.”  Dr. Didier Raoult, the Anthony Fauci of France, had such spectacular success using HCQ to treat victims of SARS-CoV-2 that he said way back on February 25 that “it’s game over” for coronavirus.  He and a team of researchers reported that the use of HCQ administered with both azithromycin and zinc cured 79 of 80 patients with only “rare and minor” adverse events. “In conclusion,” these researchers write, “we confirm the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine associated with azithromycin in the treatment of COVID-19 and its potential effectiveness in the early impairment of contagiousness.”  The highly-publicized VA study that purported to show HCQ was ineffective showed nothing of the sort. HCQ wasn’t administered until the patients were virtually on their deathbeds when research indicates it should be prescribed as soon as symptoms are apparent. Plus, HCQ was administered without azithromycin and zinc, which form the cocktail that makes it supremely effective. At-risk individuals need to receive the HCQ cocktail at the first sign of symptoms.  But Governor Andrew Cuomo banned the use of HCQ in the entire state of New York on March 6, the Democrat governors of Nevada and Michigan soon followed suit, and by March 28 the whole country was under incarceration-in-place fatwas.  Nothing happened with regard to the use of HCQ in the U.S. until March 20, when President Trump put his foot down and insisted that the FDA consider authorizing HCQ for off-label use to treat SARS-CoV-2.  On March 23, Dr. Vladimir Zelenko reported that he had treated around 500 coronavirus patients with HCQ and had seen an astonishing 100% success rate. That’s not the “anecdotal” evidence Dr. Fauci sneers at, but actual results with real patients in clinical settings.  “Since last Thursday, my team has treated approximately 350 patients in Kiryas Joel and another 150 patients in other areas of New York with the above regimen. Of this group and the information provided to me by affiliated medical teams, we have had ZERO deaths, ZERO hospitalizations, and ZERO intubations. In addition, I have not heard of any negative side effects other than approximately 10% of patients with temporary nausea and diarrhea.”  Said Dr. Zelenko:  If you scale this nationally, the economy will rebound much quicker. The country will open again. And let me tell you a very important point. This treatment costs about $20. That’s very important because you can scale that nationally. If every treatment costs $20,000, that’s not so good.  All I’m doing is repurposing old, available drugs which we know their safety profiles, and using them in a unique combination in an outpatient setting.  The questions are disturbing to a spectacular degree. If Dr. Fauci has known since 2005 of the effectiveness of HCQ, why hasn’t it been administered immediately after people show symptoms, as Dr. Zelenko has done? Maybe then nobody would have died and nobody would have been incarcerated in place except the sick, which is who a quarantine is for in the first place. To paraphrase Jesus, it’s not the symptom-free who need HCQ but the sick. And they need it at the first sign of symptoms.  While the regressive health care establishment wants the HCQ cocktail to only be administered late in the course of the infection, from a medical standpoint, this is stupid. Said one doctor, “As a physician, this baffles me. I can’t think of a single infectious condition — bacterial, fungal, or viral — where the best medical treatment is to delay the use of an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, or anti-viral until the infection is far advanced.”  So why has Dr. Fauci minimized and dismissed HCQ at every turn instead of pushing this thing from jump street? He didn’t even launch clinical trials of HCQ until April 9, by which time 33,000 people had died.  This may be why: “Chloroquine, a relatively safe, effective and cheap drug used for treating many human diseases...is effective in inhibiting the infection and spread of SARS CoV.” That’s the problem. It is safe, inexpensive, and it works - in other words, there’s nothing sexy or avant-garde about HCQ. It’s been around since 1934.  Given human nature, it’s possible, even likely, that those who are chasing the unicorn of a coronavirus vaccine are doing so for reasons other than human health. I can’t see into anybody’s heart, and can’t presume to know their motives, but on the other hand, human nature recognizes that there’s no glory in pushing HCQ, and nobody is going to get anything named for him in the history books. The polio vaccine was developed by Jonas Salk in 1954, and it is still known as the “Salk vaccine.” There will be no “Fauci vaccine” if HCQ is the answer to the problem.  So while Dr. Fauci is tut-tutting and pooh-poohing HCQ, Dr. Raoult and Dr. Zelensky are out there saving lives at $20 a pop. Maybe we should spend more time listening to them than the wizards-of-smart bureaucrats the Talking Snake Media fawns over.  Dr. Fauci is regarded by the Talking Snake Media as the Oracle at Delphi. The entire nation hangs on his every word. But if nobody is dying and nobody is locked down, his 15 minutes of fame fades to zero. Very few people are not going to be influenced by that prospect, especially when it’s easy to keep the attention of the public by continuing to feed the panic.  It should not be overlooked that there is no money in HCQ for Big Pharma since HCQ is a generic that can be manufactured so cheaply there is little profit margin in it. On the other hand, the payday for a vaccine will literally be off-the-charts. Who knows what kind of behind-the-scenes pressure is being put on Fauci and others in the health care establishment?  There is a monstrous reputational risk for those who will be found to have dismissively waved off a treatment that could have been used from the very beginning, even back on February 15 when Dr. Fauci said that the risk from Coronavirus was “minuscule.” How many lives could have been saved if the heads of our multi-billion dollar health care bureaucracy had been advocating for HCQ treatment from day one? We’ll never know. Instead, their advice has been dangerous and deadly in every sense of that word.  Someday - maybe even today - we will be able to identify the individuals who had the knowledge and expertise to make a global difference, but turned up their noses at the solution when it could have made all the difference in the world.",false

Apparently I’m not alone thinking this paper’s conclusion is “bat-shit” wild pardon the pun. We need to replicate this study now before the world goes mad. Let’s all pause and hold our breath please 😷. https://t.co/Vrjcn9FCm7 January 31, 2020  The situation is fluid. Who knows what researchers will discover next?  * * *  Over the past few days, the mainstream press has vigorously pushed back against a theory about the origins of the coronavirus that has now infected as many as 70,000+ people in Wuhan alone depending on whom you believe. The theory is that China obtained the coronavirus via a Canadian research program, and started molding it into a bioweapon at the Institute of Virology in Wuhan. Politifact pointed the finger at Zero Hedge, in particular, though the story was widely shared across independent-leaning media.  The theory is that the virus, which was developed by infectious disease experts may have originated in the Wuhan-based lab of Dr. Peng Zhou , China's preeminent researcher of bat immune systems, specifically in how their immune systems adapt to the presence of viruses like coronavirus and other destructive viruses. Somehow, the virus escaped from the lab, and the Hunan fish market where the virus supposedly originated is merely a ruse.  Now, a respected epidemiologist who recently caught flack for claiming in a twitter threat that the virus appeared to be much more contagious than initially believed is pointing out irregularities in the virus's genome that suggests it might have been genetically engineered for the purposes of a weapon, and not just any weapon but the deadliest one of all.  and instead appear to be closer to HIV. The virus even responds to treatment by HIV medications. In  Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag , Indian researchers are baffled by segments of the virus's RNA that have no relation to other coronaviruses like SARS,  For those pressed for time, here are the key findings from the paper, which first focuses on the unique nature of 2019-nCoV, and then observe four amino acid sequences in the Wuhan Coronavirus which are homologous to amino acid sequences in HIV1:  Our phylogentic tree of full-length coronaviruses suggests that 2019-nCoV is closely related to SARS CoV [Fig1]. In addition, other recent studies have linked the 2019-nCoV to SARS CoV. We therefore compared the spike glycoprotein sequences of the 2019-nCoV to that of the SARS CoV NCBI Accession number: AY390556.1. On careful examination of the sequence alignment we found that the 2019- nCoV spike glycoprotein contains 4 insertions [Fig.2]. To further investigate if these inserts are present in any other corona virus, we performed a multiple sequence alignment of the spike glycoprotein amino acid sequences of all available coronaviruses n=55 [refer Table S.File1] in NCBI refseq ncbi.nlm.nih.gov this includes one sequence of 2019-nCoV[Fig.S1]. We found that these 4 insertions [inserts 1, 2, 3 and 4] are unique to 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses analyzed. Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses . Another group from China had documented three insertions comparing fewer spike glycoprotein sequences of coronaviruses Zhou et al., 2020. We then translated the aligned genome and found that these inserts are present in all Wuhan 2019-nCoV viruses except the 2019-nCoV virus of Bat as a host [Fig.S4]. Intrigued by the 4 highly conserved inserts unique to 2019-nCoV we wanted to understand their origin. For this purpose, we used the 2019-nCoV local alignment with each insert as query against all virus genomes and considered hits with 100% sequence coverage. Surprisingly, each of the four inserts aligned with short segments of the Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 HIV-1 proteins. The amino acid positions of the inserts in 2019-nCoV and the corresponding residues in HIV-1 gp120 and HIV-1 Gag are shown in Table 1. The first 3 inserts insert 1,2 and 3 aligned to short segments of amino acid residues in HIV-1 gp120. The insert 4 aligned to HIV-1 Gag. The insert 1 6 amino acid residues and insert 2 6 amino acid residues in the spike glycoprotein of 2019-nCoV are 100% identical to the residues mapped to HIV-1 gp120. The insert 3 12 amino acid residues in 2019- nCoV maps to HIV-1 gp120 with gaps [see Table 1]. The insert 4 8 amino acid residues maps to HIV-1 Gag with gaps.  Why do the authors think the virus may be man-made? Because when looking at the above insertions which are not present in any of the closest coronavirus families, it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. Instead, they can be found in cell identification and membrane binding proteins located in the HIV genome.  Since the S protein of 2019-nCoV shares closest ancestry with SARS GZ02, the sequence coding for spike proteins of these two viruses were compared using MultiAlin software. We found four new insertions in the protein of 2019-nCoV- “GTNGTKR” IS1, “HKNNKS” IS2, “GDSSSG” IS3 and “QTNSPRRA” IS4 Figure 2. To our surprise, these sequence insertions were not only absent in S protein of SARS but were also not observed in any other member of the Coronaviridae family Supplementary figure. This is startling as it is quite unlikely for a virus to have acquired such unique insertions naturally in a short duration of time. The insertions were observed to be present in all the genomic sequences of 2019-nCoV virus available from the recent clinical isolates. To know the source of these insertions in 2019-nCoV a local alignment was done with BLASTp using these insertions as query with all virus genome. Unexpectedly, all the insertions got aligned with Human immunodeficiency Virus-1 HIV-1. Further analysis revealed that aligned sequences of HIV-1 with 2019-nCoV were derived from surface glycoprotein gp120 amino acid sequence positions: 404-409, 462-467, 136-150 and from Gag protein 366-384 amino acid Table 1. Gag protein of HIV is involved in host membrane binding, packaging of the virus and for the formation of virus-like particles. Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4.This binding induces structural rearrangements in GP120, creating a high affinity binding site for a chemokine co-receptor like CXCR4 and/or CCR5.  And some visuals, which lead the paper authors to conclude that this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect:  3D modelling of the protein structure displayed that these insertions are present at the binding site of 2019-nCoV. Due to the presence of gp120 motifs in 2019-nCoV spike glycoprotein at its binding domain, we propose that these motif insertions could have provided an enhanced affinity towards host cell receptors. Further, this structural change might have also increased the range of host cells that 2019-nCoV can infect. To the best of our knowledge, the function of these motifs is still not clear in HIV and need to be explored. The exchange of genetic material among the viruses is well known and such critical exchange highlights the risk and the need to investigate the relations between seemingly unrelated virus families.  A good recap of the findings was provided by Dr. Feigl-Ding, who started his explanatory thread by pointing out that the transmission rate outside China has surpassed the rate inside China.  But the 'smoking gun' in this case are pieces of the virus's genetic code that Indian researchers, led by Prashant Pradhan at the Indian Institute of Technology, found may have been 'embedded' from HIV, which belongs to an entirely different family of viruses.  pic.twitter.com/WeVA948xin 16. UPDATE ON 🦠 GENOME 🧬: a very intriguing new paper investigating the aforementioned mystery middle segment w/ “S” spike protein: likely origin from HIV. “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag” from https://t.co/QAX3usr7vw January 31, 2020  17. ...WHOA- the authors said the finding was “Unexpectedly” related to genes from HIV virus.

Gp120 plays crucial role in recognizing the host cell by binding to the primary receptor CD4” — Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding @DrEricDing January 31, 2020  19. Again, these are new express published findings and not peer reviewed yet. Let’s not draw conclusions yet. But evidence suggest that 2 different HIV genes 🧬 are present in the #coronarvirus S gene region that didn’t map to any other coronavirus, according to other studies. January 31, 2020  20. Further the authors add that “This indicates that these insertions have been preferably acquired by the 2019-nCoV, providing it with additional survival and infectivity advantage. Delving deeper we found that these insertions were similar to HIV-1.” 🤔 — Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding @DrEricDing January 31, 2020  21. Paper piles on: “these 🧬insertions are present at binding site of 2019-nCoV.

The authors dunked this final conclusion: “This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous”. Wow, they sure just went straight there! 😱 What a bold paper... I don’t know what to say 🤷🏻",false
a14a969b,NY Senate Republican Conference Slams Democrats For Giving Illegal Immigrants Free Tuition While Halting Applications For Struggling Citizen Students During Pandemic,"DREAM Act applications roll in while Excelsior Scholarship applications are suspended by One Party Rule in New York  ALBANY, NY – The New York State Senate Republican Conference today slammed Democrats who have kept applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants open while closing the Excelsior Scholarship application available to citizen students, whose families are struggling even more due to forced business closures during the coronavirus pandemic.  “Time and time again, Democrats show New Yorkers their true priorities and under One Party Rule, illegal immigrants come before hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers. When Senate Democrats voted to create free tuition for illegal immigrants, Republicans said no. To add insult to injury, so many families are facing an even more dire financial hardship after Governor Cuomo forced their livelihoods shut. To close citizen students out of the application process while continuing to give illegal immigrants free tuition is ludicrous. New Yorkers shouldn’t be funding tuition for illegal immigrants at all, and we should be closing down that program permanently as we look to find savings in our budget,” said Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt.  Tuition for SUNY schools is due in August, leaving parents nervous as they check the still closed application page.  “Middle class, law-abiding, taxpaying parents are struggling right now. They and their children deserve answers. New York State should not be playing politics with their futures,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “If anyone ever needed a crystal clear example of the Senate Democrat’s ‘Bizzaro World’ priorities that put illegal immigrants first and hardworking, law-abiding taxpayers dead last, look no further than this latest shameful policy. In January 2019, Senate Democrats rammed through their so-called ‘DREAM Act’ giving free college to illegal immigrants. I voted no and said their DREAM Act was a nightmare for taxpayers to the tune of $27 million annually. Now in July 2020, Senate Democrats show they’ve learned nothing as they’re shamefully keeping open applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students, many of whom have families that are financially reeling due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This latest policy hypocrisy shows that the Senate Democrats continue catering to their illegal immigrant base while law-abiding taxpayers get another slap in the face,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “There may be disagreement as to whether those who are here illegally should be getting the benefits of legal citizens, but there should be no disagreement that state government should not be discriminating against citizen students and their families who are part of the Excelsior Program and who are anxiously waiting for their tuition relief applications to be processed. Every legislator took an oath of office to represent the interests of the legal citizens of this state and nation and they will have to answer to those voters in November if they fail to uphold that oath,” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “We have law-abiding, hardworking families across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions struggling to make ends meet, paying outrageously high state and local taxes, and going into huge amounts of debt trying to afford college for their children. It’s not right to ignore the needs and the hopes of these families while we turn around and continue to deliver hard-earned taxpayer dollars to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrant families,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “The thousands of New York students who have been shut out of this application process with no explanation from the state deserve immediate answers. Countless New Yorkers are facing unprecedented economic hardship as a result of state actions and now the state is just adding insult to injury by leaving them in this limbo. It is absolutely unacceptable and the state needs to get its priorities in order,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “Only in NYC-Democrat-ruled New York would you send law-abiding, taxpaying families to the back of the line while giving illegal immigrants preferential treatment when it comes to college tuition aid. Every parent and student who was counting on the Excelsior Scholarship for the fall semester and is now desperately worrying about how to pay the August bill deserves an explanation as to why they’ve been put on hold while applications and aid are flowing for illegal immigrants seeking a free college education at taxpayer expense. It’s outrageous, unfair, and it symbolizes everything that’s wrong in Albany under One Party Rule,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Many New Yorkers have suffered and continue to experience significant challenges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While I believe access to a quality education is important, we should not be prioritizing one segment of the state’s population, especially during this difficult time. Our focus must be on providing assistance to the state’s hardworking residents, families, business owners, and taxpayers who are struggling,” said Senator Joe Griffo.  “Senate Democrats have been clear about their priorities since day one – those that break the rules come first and those that follow the rules take a back seat. Senate Republicans have always stood with law-abiding citizens and this case is no exception,” said Senator Rich Funke.  “It is unconscionable that Democrats would punish students whose only crime is that they are citizens. It is no wonder that hard-working New York families are leaving the state in droves,” said Senator Andrew Lanza.  ###",partially false
673f05fa,Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung,"Manchin and Capito Introduce Legislation to Improve Early Detection of Black Lung  Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin D-WV and Shelley Moore Capito R-WV introduced legislation to boost participation in federal programs that detect and treat black lung disease among coal miners.  “Coal miners sacrifice a lot, including their own health, to keep our lights on, heat our homes, and power our businesses. Black lung cases are at a 25-year high and with today’s technology and our knowledge of this disease, that is simply unacceptable. Our amendment will make sure more miners participate in early detection so we can catch it and treat it quicker. The health and safety of our miners should always be our number one priority and I will be fighting for this amendment to be included in the final spending bill,” Senator Manchin said.  “West Virginia coal miners have worked tirelessly for decades to keep industries and communities in this country moving,” Senator Capito said. “These resources dedicated to the early detection of black lung could be life-saving for thousands of hardworking West Virginians. Amazing work is being done in this area by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health’s Respiratory Health Division in Morgantown, and I am honored to help that work continue and provide assistance to those who have given so much to our state.”  According to a recent study published in the American Journal of Public Health, cases of black lung are at a 25-year high in Appalachian coal mining states, with as many as one in five underground coal miners in the region having evidence of black lung. In order to address this worsening public health crisis, Senators Manchin and Capito have filed an amendment to the defense, labor, health and education spending package currently under consideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate aiming to improve the participation rate of coal miners in federal health surveillance programs that detect and treat black lung. Specifically, the amendment requires the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to submit a report to Congress on ways to boost outreach efforts to increase participation in the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program CWHSP and to identify barriers that deter miners with black lung from accessing treatment. CWHSP is a national program that offers free health screening services to coal miners, including chest X-rays, lung function testing, respiratory health assessment questionnaires, and extended health surveillance. However, the current national participation rate in CWHSP is approximately 35 percent among active miners and even lower among retirees.  ###",true

On the panel, Missouri Republican Party Executive Director Jean Evans and attorney Jane Dueker talked crime in St. Louis, among other topics.  “Missouri, in general, has more crime, percentage-wise, than the rest of the country. So we are seeing overall crime throughout the country is going down but not here in Missouri,” said Evans.  Last week marked the official launch of Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s plan to combat violent crime in the region. The same week, St. Louis elected officials passed the Cure Violence plan.  To Evans, Parson stepping in “takes political courage” and puts much-needed boots on the ground.  “Freeing up some more police officers, because you don’t go in and rob a bank when there is a cop car outside,” Evans said.  Dueker noted the police officers “are grateful for any sort of help.”  But, that is just one step to addressing the issue, she said.  “I think you have to do a multifaceted approach, and I’m not exactly seeing that yet.

684c9ba4,MI Sec of State Official Caught On Video Telling Volunteers To Count “Multiple Ballots with the very Same Signature” During “Audit” Of Votes In Antrim County,"Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno is an American hero. Two weeks ago, Michigan 13th Circuit Court Judge Kevin A Elsenheimer agreed to allow Mr. DePerno’s client, William Bailey, and a highly skilled team of IT experts to perform a forensic examination on 16 of the Dominion voting machines in Antrim County. On Monday, Judge Elsenheimer agreed to allow the results of the forensic examination to be released to the public. The results were damning.  THE REPORT:  After the forensic examination of 16 Dominion Voting machines in Antrim, Co., MI, Allied Security Operations Group has concluded that the Dominion Voting machines were assigned a 68.05% error rate. DePerno explained that when ballots are put through the machine, a whopping 68.05% error rate means that 68.05% of the ballots are sent for bulk adjudication, which means they collect the ballots in a folder. “The ballots are sent somewhere where people in another location can change the vote,” DePerno explained. The allowable election error rate established by the Federal Election Commission guidelines is 1 in 250,000 ballots or .0008%.  Based on the Allied Security Operations report, Constitutional Attorney Matthew DePerno states: “we conclude that The Dominion Voting System should not be used in Michigan. We further conclude that the results of Antrim County should not have been certified.  The stunning report was widely criticized by the Democrat Party mainstream media and by the dishonest Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.  TRENDING: Our Motherf*ckin Streets! Antifa Terrorists March Through NYC in Riot Gear - Media Silent VIDEO  Following the bombshell findings by Mr. DePerno and his team of IT experts, a “risk-limited audit” was ordered by Sec. of State Benson. Constitutional Attorney Matt DePerno was invited to observe the “risk-limiting audit” of Antrim County’s vote that took place yesterday in the Kearney Twp. hall in Bellaire, MI., where 6 officials from the Secretary of State continuously walked around the room observing and correcting the counters who dared to stray from their objectives.  According to Verified Voting: The risk-limiting audit process can be conducted on any set of paper ballots that has a record of the number of ballots cast, how they are stored, and how to retrieve any particular ballot ballot manifest. For an RLA to meaningfully support confidence in the reported election outcome, the standard is higher, and requires the following:  Paper ballots preferably marked by hand and supplemented with a ballot marking device for those who need to use one.  A deliberate and intentional step for a voter to check the paper ballot for accuracy before casting the ballot voter verification.  Rigorous ballot accounting and a properly maintained chain of custody of the ballots.  If photographic evidence proves seals on the Dominion voting machines were broken on November 27, how can a “properly maintained chain of custody of ballots” be assured. The answer is, it can’t.  Before her so-called audit was completed, Sec of State Benson explained the purpose of the “risk limited audit” to the media while ensuring the integrity of the elections in Michigan:  “While we know the machine tabulators functioned properly in Antrim, we are conducting this audit to assure the public of what countless officials from both parties at the federal, state and local levels have already confirmed – that this was the most secure election in our nation’s history and the certified results are an accurate reflection of the will of the voters,” adding, “It is time for Michigan, and the nation to once and for all dismiss the meritless disinformation campaign that seeks to undermine the integrity of our election and move forward in support of our collective democracy.”  Mr. DePerno, who acted as an observer to the “risk-limited audit,” doesn’t agree with Ms. Benson about the integrity of Michigan’s election and has provided us with video and photographic evidence to prove that he was again able to debunk her statement about the “most secure election in our nation’s history.”  The first video provided by Matthew DePerno shows a bin of ballots from Mancelona Township, Precinct #1. The bin was delivered to three of the 20 bi-partisan volunteers that included several Antrim Co. city clerks who agreed to assist with the “risk-limited audit.”  Inside the bin, tabulated ballots were mixed in with ballots that were never tabulated, and several blank ballots were mixed in as well. Mr. DePerno referred to the bin of ballots as “an absolute mess!” On December 16, we reported about photographs taken at Mancelona Township’s Precinct #1 on November 27, 2020, that showed both of the security seals on the Dominion Voting machine were missing.  The second video was taken at a table where ballots were being counted in Helena Twp. The volunteers can be seen questioning why there were fewer ballots in the bin than the original number that was recorded in the previous recount? Shortly after asking the question, a male SOS official approached the table with a bag marked “spoiled ballots” and told them to count them. ATtorney Matt DePerno witnessed the unidentified male SOS rep pulling the “spoiled ballot bag out of the bin and delivering it to the volunteers who were “auditing” the ballots. DePerno also witnessed the SOS official telling them to add the “spoiled ballots” to the count.  The third video was taken at a table where the ballots from Central Lake Twp. were being counted. In the video, a male counter can be seen questioning “multiple ballots with the same signature.” According to Matthew DePerno, 138 ballots had write-in-votes where the penmanship was exactly the same.  In the video below, the SOS official can be seen demanding that the counters ignore what they believe is voter fraud and count the ballots.  “We need to do the counts because if we don’t have the counts, then we can’t move forward. And we understand that there is a concern with this precinct—but this is not a time for you to be investigating right now.”  “Did you find something else?” the male counter asks.  “No,” she replies, adding, “So, you need to move forward with the audit, so we can get the numbers, so we can see how many ballots are here.”  The female counter asks, “So when we’re done with the audit, there’s still the opportunity to challenge the fact that we have multiple ballots with the very same signature?” she asks.  “I don’t know if ‘challenge’ is the right word,” the SOS official says.  “But we’re challenging—” the volunteer says.  The male volunteer tells the SOS, “We’ll go ahead and count the ballots moving forward, but we will separate out, and count those— there’s going to be an asterisk, saying ‘these ballots have the same signature.'”  “And again, we know that you have a concern with this precinct,” she tells them, explaining, “That’s not your role at this very moment,” as she continues to push for them to ignore the multiple matching signatures and only count the ballots.  “What I need you to do right now is finish the audit,” she tells them again. Both of the volunteers explain that they are going to make a note of the ballots, to which the SOS official replies, “Again, that is not the process.”  The SOS official implores them to continue to count the presidential ballots.  At no point does the SOS official assure them that the issue of the multiple potentially fraudulent ballots will be addressed, but instead demands that they count them as if they were all legitimate ballots.  In this video, the SOS official can be seen telling the volunteers who are objecting to adding the ballots in question to the vote total, “This is not an investigation right now!”  On December 16, one day after Dominion Voting Systems CEO John Poulos testified in front of the MI Senate Oversight Committee, Mr. DePerno contacted us to say Poulos was incorrect in his statement that the ballots were securely stored. In fact, Mr. Derno provided us with photos showing seals were broken on one of the tabulators. DePerno explained, “In Central Lake, the lock that protects the side data port where you can insert a thumb drive in order to perform a software upgrade, that could change the program, was missing.” He explains, “The missing lock gives the ability of any person, including a voter to change the Dominion Voting machine program.”  Mr. DePerno explained to us that once the seals are broken, and the lock is removed, the integrity of the machines has been compromised. “It definitely showed that someone had accessed the inside of the tabulator, and it no longer represents a secure voting platform,” DePerno said.  The bin or box seen in the image below is where the ballots are stored. DePerno explained, “If you remove the tape, it gives you the ability to separate the tabulator from the box that contains the ballots.”  The photo below shows the stack of ballots in Central Lake that were cast for Joe Biden. The ballots that are pulled forward are all ballots that the counters pulled forward after objecting to the legitimacy of the ballots.  Mr. DePerno was stunned by the number of blank ballots that were mixed in with actual ballots, saying that he believes he observed more blank ballots in the recount than there are registered voters in Antrim County.  DePerno told us, “The guidelines from RLA were not followed. What they did yesterday was not an audit under those guidelines. It was a hand recount of the presidential race only and failed to address many of the problems with down-ballot races. Members of the public who assisted in the hand recount were not allowed to ask any questions or question any ballots. This hand recount also failed to address any of the glaring problems from the erroneous counts conducted on November 3 and November 6. Yesterday was nothing more than political theatre designed to allow the Secretary of State to again publish the same false narrative to the Michigan voters. Yesterday, when the people conducting the count dared ask questions, they were shut down.”  DePerno’s forensic and photographic evidence should be enough to call the entire Michigan election into question. Will the media or the courts care, or have we now entered a period in our nation’s history where we have officially become a Banana Republica after decades of Republicans ignoring the corruption of our media and our judicial system.",false

WBFO's Mike Desmond reports  Both chairmen pointed to Trump being a New Yorker who is familiar with Upstate from his travels while considering a run for governor.  Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford and we found that to be substantial, Langworthy said. He carried towns that haven't gone Republican in years and years in a presidential election. Towns like West Seneca and Hamburg and he won Cheektowaga, a critical town. That means, frankly, that there is cross-over Democratic appeal for his candidacy.  They lost because they did not have a candidate who was a leader, who could have a vision for this country, who addressed the real problems of this country, particularly in the swing states, which were contested and which she lost 48-46, those swing states where there was a real contest going on, Cox said. Donald Trump won because he is a leader and he had a vision for America.  They also pointed to Congressman Chris Collins, his key role in the presidential campaign and his continuing role defending decisions made by the president-elect.  Locally, they also pointed to the way Democratic regions in Erie County turned out to vote Republican this year, a sign of potential future change. Cox also pointed to the election of Chris Jacobs as essential to continuing Republican control of the State Senate.    Holding on to a majority in the State Senate because of Chris Jacobs' win here in Erie County is also historic because, of course, we lost that majority in 2008, Cox said. We lost it again in 2012. In this presidential year, we held on to our majority in the State Senate because of Chris Jacobs' win here.  Cox said it is even more important because a Republican seat on Long Island has possibly flipped to the Democrats. The state chairman said that vote followed the indictment of the Senate candidate's father on corruption charges, something he calls political in bringing the charges close to the election.",false
186685b0,Irrefutable: The coronavirus was engineered by scientists in a lab using well documented genetic engineering vectors that leave behind a “fingerprint”,"Natural News Every virology lab in the world that has run a genomic analysis of the coronavirus now knows that the coronavirus was engineered by human scientists. The proof is in the virus itself: The tools for genetic insertion are still present as remnants in the genetic code. Since these unique gene sequences don’t occur by random chance, they’re proof that this virus was engineered by scientists in a lab.  But the WHO and CDC are covering up this inconvenient fact in order to protect communist China and its biological weapons program, since no government wants the public to know the full truth about how frequently government-run labs experience outbreaks. Decades ago, for example, the U.S. Army ran an Ebola bioweapons lab in the United States, where a monkey infected one of the scientists there. The strain turned out to be infectious only in monkeys, not humans, so the world dodged a bullet, but the U.S. Army “nuked” the entire facility with chemical bombs, killing all the monkeys and wiping out any last remnant of the virus on U.S. soil.  You can read the full details of that incident in the book The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. We’ve also covered it at NaturalNews.com, where this book description is reprinted:  In 1989, Reston, VA — one of the most famous U.S. planned communities located about 10 miles from Washington DC — stood at the epicenter of a potential biological disaster. This well-known story was narrated by Richard Preston in a bone chilling account related to the recognition and containment of a devastating tropical filovirus at a monkey facility — the Reston Primate Quarantine Unit.  That outbreak occurred because Ebola was found to be spreading through the air ducts, confirming that Ebola can spread through the air. This simple fact was vigorously covered up by the entire medical establishment during the Ebola scare in the United States many years later, where the CDC transported an infected patient to a hospital in Dallas, subsequently infecting a nurse who was treated with highly toxic chemicals that caused permanent kidney damage she later sued the hospital for the damage she suffered.  The reason this is relevant is because in order to understand the coronavirus situation in China, we must first realize that virology research labs routinely experience lapses in containment. Even the United States has failed to contain deadly viral strains when trying to study them. China’s BSL-4 labs have experienced multiple accidental releases of SARS strains, and this new coronavirus is now confirmed to be an engineered strain that was either used in bioweapons research or vaccine experiments.  The genomic coding in the virus is not natural, in other words. Just as you would never encounter a snake in the desert that’s writing a book containing words and grammatical structure, the genetic sequences now identified in the coronavirus strain are, without question, proof that human engineers have been tinkering with the strain.  How to genetically engineer viruses: the pShuttle vector  One of the tools used to accomplish this genetic engineering is called pShuttle. It’s a genetic tool set that can carry a payload of genes to be inserted into the target virus.  Researchers engaged in genetic engineering can purchase the pShuttle sequence from online retailers such as AddGenes.org, which sells the sequence for $75, shipped in “bacteria as agar stab.”  The following map outlines the complete gene sequence of the pShuttle tool:  The method for using pShuttle is described in a PubMed document entitled, “A simplified system for generating recombinant adenoviruses.”  The summary of the paper describes, “a strategy that simplifies the generation and production of such viruses.” Here’s how the process works to achieve genetic engineering of viruses:  A recombinant adenoviral plasmid is generated with a minimum of enzymatic manipulations, using homologous recombination in bacteria rather than in eukaryotic cells. After transfections of such plasmids into a mammalian packaging cell line, viral production is conveniently followed with the aid of green fluorescent protein, encoded by a gene incorporated into the viral backbone. Homogeneous viruses can be obtained from this procedure without plaque purification.  The paper describes how this approach will, “expedite the process of generating and testing recombinant adenoviruses.”  During this process, of course, the pShuttle leaves behind unique code, a “fingerprint” of the genetic modification. It is this fingerprint that has now been identified in the coronavirus.  As revealed by genomics researcher James Lyons-Weiler in this bombshell analysis article, the pShuttle genetic code is found in the coronavirus that’s circulating in the wild.  This is proof that the virus has been engineered by human scientists.  “IPAK researchers found a sequence similarity between a pShuttle-SN recombination vector sequence and INS1378,” writes Lyons-Weiler for IPAK:  Another gene sequence also shows a 92% match with the Spike protein from the SARS coronavirus:  The process for achieving this was patented by Chinese researchers as shown in this patent link.  The pShuttle vector was used to insert SARS genes into the coronavirus, a process that makes it deadly to humans. “The very researchers conducting studies on SARS vaccines have cautioned repeatedly against human trials,” warns Lyons-Weiler:  The disease progression in of 2019-nCoV is consistent with those seen in animals and humans vaccinated against SARS and then challenged with re-infection. Thus, the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV is an experimental vaccine type must be seriously considered.  He also warns about, “studies that have reported serious immunopathology in animals – rats, ferrets, and monkeys – in which animals vaccinated against coronoviruses tended to have extremely high rates of respiratory failure upon subsequent exposure in the study when challenged with the wild-type coronavirus.”  He concludes:  If the Chinese government has been conducting human trials against SARS. MERS, or other coronviruses using recombined viruses, they may have made their citizens far more susceptible to acute respiratory distress syndrome upon infection with 2019-nCoV coronavirus.  Brighteon.com/a4d2afed-56c6-4602-b6ab-6f777ba4a69a  Another doctor from Beijing Medical University warns the virus appears to be genetically engineered  Lyons-Weiler is not alone in his assessment of the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus. Dr. Yuhong Dong, who holds a doctorate degree in infectious diseases from Beijing University, writes in The Epoch Times:  Based on recently published scientific papers, this new coronavirus has unprecedented virologic features that suggest genetic engineering may have been involved in its creation. The virus presents with severe clinical features, thus it poses a huge threat to humans. It is imperative for scientists, physicians, and people all over the world, including governments and public health authorities, to make every effort to investigate this mysterious and suspicious virus in order to elucidate its origin and to protect the ultimate future of the human race.    Dr. Yuhong reminds us that a Jan. 30 science paper published in The Lancet concludes that, “recombination is probably not the reason for emergence of this virus.” In other words, this did not occur through natural mutations in the wild.  He also points to a Jan. 27th study by five Greek scientists who also concluded the coronavirus has no lineage to other viruses in the “family tree” that’s found in the wild. He writes:  A Jan. 27 2020, study by 5 Greek scientists analyzed the genetic relationships of 2019-nCoV and found that “the new coronavirus provides a new lineage for almost half of its genome, with no close genetic relationships to other viruses within the subgenus of sarbecovirus,” and has an unusual middle segment never seen before in any coronavirus. All this indicates that 2019-nCoV is a brand-new type of coronavirus. The study’s authors rejected the original hypothesis that 2019-nCoV originated from random natural mutations between different coronaviruses.  “No bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market”  Dr. Yuhong writes about The Lancet study by authors Roujian Lu et al., from the China Key Laboratory of Biosafety, National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, repeating a quote from that paper:  First, the outbreak was first reported in late December 2019, when most bat species in Wuhan are hibernating. Second, no bats were sold or found at the Huanan seafood market, whereas various non-aquatic animals including mammals were available for purchase. Third, the sequence identity between 2019-nCoV and its close relatives bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 was less than 90%. Hence, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 are not direct ancestors of 2019-nCoV.  In other words, it isn’t from bats.  That means the entire mainstream media is lying to us about the real origins of the coronavirus.  That same paper goes on to underscore the misinformation in the official explanation, stating, “Many of the initially confirmed 2019-nCoV cases—27 of the first 41 in one report, 26 of 47 in another—were connected to the Wuhan market, but up to 45%, including the earliest handful, were not. This raises the possibility that the initial jump into people happened elsewhere.”  Both Lu in The Lancet paper linked above and Lyons-Weiler point to the presence of a SARS binding protein sequence in the coronavirus that allows it to easily infect human cells. As explained in The Epoch Times:  …despite considerable genetics distance between the Wuhan CoV and the human-infecting SARS-CoV, and the overall low homology of the Wuhan CoV S-protein to that of SARS-CoV, the Wuhan CoV S-protein had several patches of sequences in the receptor binding RBD domain with a high homology to that of SARS-CoV. The residues at positions 442, 472, 479, 487, and 491 in SARS-CoV S-protein were reported to be at receptor complex interface and considered critical for cross species and human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV. So to our surprise, despite replacing four out of five important interface amino acid residues, the Wuhan CoV S-protein was found to have a significant binding affinity to human ACE2. …The Wuhan CoV S-protein and SARS-CoV S-protein shared an almost identical 3-D structure in the RBD domain, thus maintaining similar van der Waals and electrostatic properties in the interaction interface. Thus the Wuhan CoV is still able to pose a significant public health risk for human transmission via the S protein–ACE2 binding pathway. emphasis added    As Dr. Yuhong asks, “How could this novel virus be so intelligent as to mutate precisely at selected sites while preserving its binding affinity to the human ACE2 receptor? How did the virus change just four amino acids of the S-protein? Did the virus know how to use Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats CRISPR to make sure this would happen?”  It couldn’t happen by chance, in other words. The coronavirus is not a random mutation in the wild. It was engineered.  Many other scientists around the world are now investigating the gene sequences found in the coronavirus, and they are increasingly concluding that elements of the virus have been engineered.  Many of those scientists are being threatened and censored. One paper has so far been forced to be withdrawn and revised, no doubt to remove the key conclusions that point to the genetic engineering origins of the coronavirus, but the proof of its engineering cannot be denied forever.  Brighteon.com/0bddc3da-f590-445e-ac38-9a74e358a57c  Either the coronavirus was genetically engineered, or the science establishment is going to have to throw out the entire field of genomics research and claim it isn’t real  Eventually, the science establishment is either going to have to conclude that this coronavirus strain was engineered, or that all the laws of genetics science don’t work, and gene sequencing is imaginary sort of like transgenderism by the “progressive” Left, which has already abandoned biological reality.  So far they’ve tried to bamboozle the public into believing this is all some sort of accident from Mother Nature, but that has only worked because most of the public doesn’t understand enough science to counter the official propaganda. However, there are more than enough independent scientists around the world to prove that this pandemic strain was engineered by humans. More evidence is coming out each day.  Interestingly, as this article is going to press, all the official numbers of infections and deaths from coronavirus have been frozen for about 14 hours and counting, almost as if every nation of the world has agreed to stop reporting new numbers. This may be a temporary situation that gets resolved in the next few hours, but it’s highly suspicious. For the last week, we’ve been getting new updates about every 12 hours or sooner, and we’ve never seen the count frozen for this long.  At the same time, an 11th case of coronavirus has now been confirmed by the CDC in the United States, revealing that infections are continuing to spread in the USA, despite the efforts of the CDC to contain the outbreak.

aacdc4d3,Democratic Lawmaker introduces bill to rename Southern States – Washington Exterminator,"Today, Congresswoman Maxine Waters D-CA, Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, introduced H.R. 2020, the Erasing Confederate History Act of 2020, legislation that provides a comprehensive plan to rename the 11 states that made up the original Confederacy.  South Carolina was the first to secede, on December 20, 1860, followed by Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana and Texas. On February 8, 1861, representatives of those states announced the formation of the Confederate States of America, with its capital at Montgomery, Alabama. After the Civil War began in April, four slave states of the Upper South—Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee, and North Carolina—also seceded and joined the Confederacy.  “It’s an insult to African-Americans who are descendants of slaves living in the formerly Rebel states to live under the same state name that enslaved their forefathers.”  Republicans in the House, the political party of the Great Emancipator Abraham Lincoln, said it should be up to these States to decide their own name as well as their state flag.  take our poll - story continues below  Should the Government be Mandating Masks?

752ab8f7,“Rallying the World” to Defeat Malaria,"This map from the collection of The College of Physicians Historical Medical Library shows deaths from typhoid fever and malaria in Washington, D.C. between 1888 and 1892. / Photo courtesy of The College of Physicians of Philadelphia  Did you know at least eight U.S. presidents are believed to have contracted malaria during their lifetime? Or that even as late as the 1930s, the U.S. recorded millions of malaria cases within its borders?  Yet by 1951, the spread of malaria was halted in the United States.  If we can do it here, we can do the same around the world.  In President Obama’s final State of the Union address, he defined American leadership as “rallying the world behind causes that are right.”  “We are on track to end the scourge of HIV/AIDS — that’s within our grasp,” President Obama said in his speech on Jan. 12. “And we have the chance to accomplish the same thing with malaria. … That’s American strength. That’s American leadership. And that kind of leadership depends on the power of our example.”  These global health goals are no longer deemed too ambitious or too complex. And that’s because we’ve done it before.  The story of U.S. leadership in the fight against infectious diseases is one of immense success and progress. From smallpox, measles, Guinea worm and polio, to malaria and Ebola, our determination, grit and know-how have helped eliminate or push many killers to the brink of extinction.  Although we’ve exceeded our ambitious malaria goals in the last decade under the U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative, we still have a long way to go. Malaria continues to cause unacceptable levels of death and suffering. In Africa, a child dies every minute because of the disease.",partially false
610801c6,The truth is coming out: 30% of parents realize flu shots spread the flu… vaccine industry in total panic to censor all real science about vaccines,"Natural News Shocking new survey data shows that a growing number of parents are waking up to the vaccine industry’s lies — at least when it comes to flu shots. While vaccine skepticism is largely maligned by the mainstream media, the truth is that a substantial number of professionals are turning their backs on Big Pharma. Anti-vax nurses are coming out of the woodwork to tell their stories, and many top scientists are now refusing to vaccinate their own children.  It is no wonder that a growing number of Americans are realizing Big Pharma and the government elite do not have the public’s best interests in mind. And as polling data from Orlando Health Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children shows, many Americans are now realizing just that.  Flu shot skepticism on the rise  The mainstream medical community has been working tirelessly with the establishment media and the pharmaceutical industry to push the narrative that all vaccines are safe and that the flu shot is necessary for “good” health. But despite their best efforts, national polling data shows that nearly half of American parents believe the flu shot can make their kids sick.  As researchers from Orlando Health report, a growing number of people are questioning the safety and efficacy of flu vaccines. Some 50 percent believe the flu shot may make their child sick, and another third of parents believed the flu shot simply didn’t work.  Twenty-eight percent of parents also stated that the flu shot might be a cause of autism.  Dr. Jean Moorjani, a pediatrician at the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, was quick to refute any and all vaccine skepticism in a recently published press release on the study’s findings. “After years of research, we know that the flu vaccine is safe,” said Dr. Moorjani.  Mother Nature's micronutrient secret: Organic Broccoli Sprout Capsules now available, delivering 280mg of high-density nutrition, including the extraordinary sulforaphane and glucosinolate nutrients found only in cruciferous healing foods. Every lot laboratory tested. See availability here.  “The flu shot does not cause autism or any other diseases or illnesses. Doctors recommend the flu shot because it is the best way to protect you and your family from the flu.”  In December 2018, a grown man was hospitalized after a routine flu vaccination left him completely paralyzed and unable to breathe independently. He was ultimately diagnosed with Guillian-Barre Syndrome, a known side effect of vaccination. It’s an autoimmune condition characterized by the immune system’s destruction of nerves, resulting in weakness or paralysis.  There are thousands of vaccine-related adverse events reported every year following vaccination, and estimates suggest that only 10 percent of vaccine reactions actually get reported.  The flu shot fraud  Despite strict adherence to the pro-vaccine narrative, the truth about vaccines can’t be ignored forever. As the polling data shows, people have questions — and they aren’t going to be satisfied with platitudes. There is no shortage of propagandists chastising the public for daring to question the validity of industry-funded vaccine science. The take-home message from vaccine propagandists is simple: Don’t question our authority, don’t question the authority of the unelected bureaucrats who run government health agencies, and certainly don’t question the “health experts” who create and push vaccines on the public.  You aren’t allowed to because you aren’t an “expert” — and only people who support the pro-vaccine agenda are allowed to be called “experts.” Gatekeeping is major problem in science today, whether you’re talking about vaccines, pesticides, climate change or GMOs. Whether it’s realized or not, corporate influence has overtaken the scientific community across the board.  If average people are too stupid to be allowed to question vaccine science, they certainly aren’t capable of consciously consenting to vaccination. Big Pharma and their puppets can’t have it both ways.  See more coverage of the latest vaccine truth at Vaccines.news.

fb721890,Still think 5G is harmless? Scientific American issues warnings about the confirmed and UNKNOWN DANGERS of 5G tech,"Natural News The oldest magazine in the United States, Scientific American, has issued a strong warning about the dangers of 5G technology. Their concerns about both the known and the potential dangers of 5G carry a lot of weight because the magazine is so influential and known for its rigorous scientific standards. In print since 1845, Scientific American is widely considered by modern fact checkers to be pro-science and highly credible.  Public health researcher Joel M. Moskowitz of the University of California, Berkeley, says in the article that 5G is a lot more harmful than the government and telecommunications industry want people to believe. He also said the same is true of Wi-Fi and cellular technology.  Exposure limits are outdated  One of his biggest concerns is related to the fact that the FCC is reaffirming exposure limits for radio frequency radiation, or RFR, that were put in place in the 1990s long before Wi-Fi, 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G existed. In other words, the FCC plans to maintain significantly outdated safety standards that do not take into account the increasing pile of evidence showing that it is harmful in many ways.  According to Moskowitz, the exposure limits set in the ‘90s were mostly related to the potential effects of RFR exposure intensity. Now, however, we know that there is a risk of cancer and other problems.  5G will introduce the use of millimeter waves, in addition to the microwaves that older cellular technologies used. Moreover, the limited reach of 5G means cell antennas will need to be placed every 100 to 200 meters, increasing people’s exposure. On top of that, new technologies in 5G such as beam-forming antennas, massive MIMO, and phased arrays, will make it difficult to measure exposure.  Short-term exposure to millimeter waves, which are absorbed by human skin and the surface layer of the cornea, can affect the nervous, cardiovascular and immune systems. Long-term exposure could put people at risk of melanoma, ocular melanoma and sterility.  Moskowitz argues that new exposure limits should be put in place that account for certain effects of signals, such as polarization and pulsing, that raise their health and biologic impacts. The current RFR exposure limits set by the FCC regulate the intensity of the exposure but ignore the RFR’s signaling properties.  Moskowitz also referred to the International EMF Scientist Appeal, which outlines how EMF impacts living beings at levels that are significantly below most guidelines. These effects include cellular stress, rises in harmful free radicals, reproductive system changes, neurological disorders, learning and memory defects and a greater cancer risk. Effects are also being noticed in plant and animal life.  The scientists who signed the appeal represent the majority of scientific experts on non-ionizing radiation, who have published more than 2,000 papers and letters on the topic of EMF in professional journals among them.  Moskowitz also takes issue with the fact that many working in the telecommunications industry and the government officials who they’ve brought over to their side label those who point out 5G’s dangers as fear mongerers. This is far from a conspiracy theory; this position is coming from a body of legitimate scientific research.  He said: “Since much of our research is publicly-funded, we believe it is our ethical responsibility to inform the public about what the peer-reviewed scientific literature tells us about the health risks from wireless radiation.”  In short, 5G can be likened to a “global human experiment without consent.” The very fact that Scientific American’s editorial board chose to print a piece that is so strongly against 5G shows that even the world’s most mainstream scientific publications have serious reservations about this technology – and that should be enough to make anyone question whether this technology should be used at all.

3bc38092,"EXCLUSIVE: NY Post’s ‘Smoking Gun’ Hunter Biden Email 100% Authentic, Forensic Analysis Concludes","An email Hunter Biden received in April 2015 from a Burisma executive discussing an introduction to then-Vice President Joe Biden, which lies at the heart of a New York Post investigation, is unquestionably authentic, a cybersecurity expert told the Daily Caller News Foundation on Thursday.  The DCNF obtained a full copy of Hunter Biden’s alleged laptop from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday. The DCNF provided Robert Graham, the founder of the cybersecurity firm Errata Security, with a copy of the email and its metadata for forensic analysis.  Graham, who has been cited as a cybersecurity expert in The Washington Post, the Associated Press, Wired, Engadget and other news and technology outlets, told the DCNF that he used a cryptographic signature found in the email’s metadata to validate that an account used by Vadym Pozharsky, an advisor to Burisma’s board of directors, emailed Hunter Biden on April 17, 2015.  In the email, Pozharsky thanked Hunter Biden for “inviting me to DC and giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together.”  The New York Post first reported the email in October, describing it as a “smoking-gun” showing that Hunter Biden had introduced his father to the Burisma executive in 2015.  The email was sent less than a year before Joe Biden pressured former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko to fire a prosecutor who was reportedly investigating the gas company in return for a $1 billion loan guarantee.  Graham previously told the DCNF that emails sent from Gmail, such as Pozharski’s message to Hunter Biden, can be “absolutely verified beyond a shadow of a doubt” by testing its contents against the unique DKIM signature found in its metadata.  Graham used the DKIM signature within the email to verify with a private key on Google’s servers that the sender, recipient, subject, date and body of the message that the DCNF obtained from Giuliani were unchanged from when the email was originally sent in April 2015. RELATED: Hunter Biden Emails Could Be ‘Absolutely Verified’ If Rudy Giuliani Released The Metadata, Expert Says  Graham said the only way the email could have been faked is if someone hacked into Google’s servers, found the private key and used it to reverse engineer the email’s DKIM signature.  Email metadata on its own does not provide any indication of whether hacking had anything to with the email’s release, Graham noted.  “Of course, committing criminal hacking doesn’t make true information any less true, so no matter how illegitimately they gathered emails, the contents are provably legitimate,” Graham said.  Joe Biden’s presidential campaign said in a statement that his schedule indicates that no such meeting as alleged in the email took place. However, the campaign later told Politico that they could not rule out the possibility he had a cursory encounter with the Burisma executive.  The email came from a computer that Hunter Biden reportedly dropped off at a Delaware-based computer repair shop in April 2019. The repair shop owner provided Giuliani a copy of the hard drive after it went unclaimed.  Hunter Biden has not denied giving his laptop to the Delaware repair shop. RELATED: Hunter Biden Isn’t Denying He Gave His Laptop To A Delaware Repair Shop  Giuliani had initially refused to provide the Daily Caller with a copy of the hard drive in mid-October, saying that questions surrounding the veracity of its contents were “pettifogging nonsense” pushed by the “liberal press.”  The Biden campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.

465eaa43,Lindell: Capitol Rioters Were Drugged By Antifa Sluts,"By Ellen Boxall  MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell is fast becoming known as the nation’s kookiest conspiracy theorist. His latest theory takes the cake.  In a post on social media dumpster fire Parler, Lindell produced a new spin on the real reason behind the Capitol attack.  “The rioters were hypnotized by antifa temptresses who hid psychoactive drugs in their vaginas,” said Lindell. “If you look at the video, many of the rioters had crazed looks in their eyes.”  Several Trump supporters are still clinging to the ridiculous fantasy that antifa was behind the attack, not Trump supporters.  Lindell is a notorious conspiracy theorist who seems to leave a trail of wreckage in his wake. Last week, a Newsmax reporter walked off the set after Lindell started ranting about fixed voting machines.  “On Tuesday, Bob Sellers tried to get a steaming Lindell back on cue: ‘We wanted to talk to you about canceling culture, if you will. We don’t want to re-litigate the allegations that you’re making, Mike.’ But Lindell wouldn’t stop talking about fraud,” said The Washington Post. “The Newsmax anchor finally asked his producers to end the segment. ‘Can we get out of here, please?’ he asked. Then the anchor simply got up and walked off the set.”  However, Lindell’s profligate lying may have finally caught up with him. He’s been banned from Twitter and his products are being kicked out of stores. Now, he’s being sued by Dominion Voting Systems.  “Despite your repeated promises—not to mention your considerable and costly efforts to bankroll a so-called investigation into Dominion—you have failed to identify a scintilla of credible evidence that even suggests that Dominion is somehow involved in a global conspiracy to harvest millions of votes in favor of President-elect Biden,” said a letter from Dominion’s attorneys. “Of course, this is because no such evidence exists. But that is of no consequence to you because you are resolutely uninterested in acknowledging the truth about these issues.”  Smartmatic, another company that makes voting software, has sued FOX News for $2.7 billion for spreading false stories about its role in election fraud.",false

The LGBTQ community worldwide has received the news of the rectal birth with open arms as the revolutionary medical procedure could enable millions of fertility-challenged couples to procreate.  James Bent, 37, received donated ovaries from his sister Leila Bent, 32, which were later successfully transplanted into his rectum and which enabled the anal birth to occur.  “I am so grateful to my sister, and to God, for making this natural birth a reality not only for us but for the millions of male same-sex couples which will follow in our path,” James Bent told reporters in tears.  “This medical procedure will not only be useful to male same-sex couples but also to heterosexual couples where the male partner wishes to experience the process of pregnancy for himself,” Dr. Peter Krisnawasti told reporters.  Other researchers believe that rectal-ovarian transplants could even be performed upon certain animals such as cows and pigs in the near future.  “It is not unimaginable that in the near future, fertility-challenged couples will be able to transplant their ovaries into the rectum of animals such as cows and pigs and bypass the pointless and painful hassle of the pregnancy process altogether” one researcher at California Hospital Medical Center explained when reached by phone.  Many analysts believe the revolutionary medical procedure performed under the supervision of Dr. Peter Krisnawasti could win the world-renowned surgeon the Nobel Prize in medicine.",false
37699224,Mary Burke stumbles when asked to define plagiarism,"Mary Burke, the Democrat running for governor, on Thursday stumbled when explaining her definition of plagiarism. The issue has come to the forefront in her race against Republican Gov. Scott Walker after it came to light her jobs plan contained passages that had appeared in other candidates’ plans.  By of the  Madison — Democratic candidate for governor Mary Burke stumbled Thursday when asked to define plagiarism and said she had not violated her principles with a jobs plan that includes nearly word-for-word sections that also appear in other candidates' plans.  Burke, who is running against GOP Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 4 election, also stressed the importance of providing citations in her plan, but an aide said later no changes to the plan would be made.  Asked by reporters to define plagiarism, Burke said: This, this probably, using words, exact words, from a source that doesn't, that isn't cited and isn't attributable.  She said she her jobs plan did not violate her principles.  When you put together economic development plans, this is about bringing in the best ideas, she said. And this is not anything more than bringing good ideas to Wisconsin, to the plans on how I'm going to move Wisconsin forward. And in describing some of these ideas, similar language was used by the consultant that was used in those ideas that he incorporated in other candidates' plans.  Last week, it surfaced that Burke's jobs plan included nearly identical passages from ones by three other Democrats — Delaware Gov. Jack Markell in 2008, Ward Cammack of Tennessee in 2009 and John Gregg of Indiana in 2012.  When the matter became public, Burke said the sections came from consultant Eric Schnurer of the Pennsylvania firm Public Works and he was no longer doing work for the campaign.  Those exact words should not have been used, that were used in other plans, and that's why we cut ties, she said Thursday. But I'll be clear about this: As governor, I'm going to welcome ideas from other places, the best ideas and best practices.  She has not modified the wording of her jobs plan, but said it was important to provide citations in her plan.  Certainly, anything that is not directly from Eric that should be cited would be cited, she said.  But afterward, Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki said the plan already included all needed citations.  Where cites are appropriate, they have been made, Zepecki said in an email. In other instances work product that has been identified as coming from Mr. Schnurer has been addressed by cutting ties with him.  BuzzFeed, the website that first reported last week on the wording of Burke's jobs plan, cited three more instances Wednesday of borrowed language. The latest examples represent a further step down in substance and significance from the previous cases of verbatim and nearly verbatim copying.  Asked after a Madison meeting whether he thought the revelations about Burke were a potential turning point in the campaign, Walker said he thought they were.  Yeah, I think that the problem for her is this isn't just some campaign flier...This was the centerpiece of her campaign, Walker said. I do think the legitimate question goes to the heart to the authenticity of the candidate.  Burke spoke to reporters Thursday at an event where she received the endorsement of the Wisconsin Professional Police Association, the state's largest police union.  In endorsing her, the union's executive director, Jim Palmer, blamed Walker for a rise in violent crime, citing FBI statistics.  Under Scott Walker, not only has Wisconsin trailed its neighbors in creating jobs, but in combating violent crime as well. The crime data shows that Wisconsin has become less safe than it was when Scott Walker took office, Palmer said. And we can no longer afford his brand of failed leadership.  Also Thursday, Walker received the endorsement of the Wisconsin Troopers Association.  It is clear that public and highway safety is a top priority of this administration, the group's executive director, Ryan Zukowski, said in a statement.  Meanwhile Thursday, the Republican Governors Association announced that New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will campaign on Monday for Walker in Hudson. That's the same day First Lady Michelle Obama is in Milwaukee for Burke.  Christie is the chairman of the Republican Governors Association and, like Walker, a potential candidate for president in 2016.

629bd28a,Danny O'Connor has more than 10 times Troy Balderson's money going into November rematch,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - After narrowly winning an Aug. 7 special election for a Columbus-area congressional seat, newly minted GOP Rep. Troy Balderson of Zanesville is badly losing the fundraising battle in his November rematch with Democratic Franklin County Recorder Danny O'Connor, Federal Election Commission filings show.  Reports that covered the pair's campaign fundraising from July 19 through Aug. 27 showed O'Connor had more than $1 million in the bank at the end of August, compared with under $93,000 for Balderson.  O'Connor took in almost $4 million during the period covered by the report, including more than $1.4 million he got after losing the election by 1,680 votes. Balderson raised slightly more than $500,000. Roughly $180,000 of the cash Balderson raised came from political action committees.  O'Connor's campaign said he got donations from more than 92,000 people in the period covered by the report, most of whom gave small amounts of money. Most donors listed in his report were from outside of Ohio.  We have thousands of people chipping in $5 and $10 at a time, said O'Connor's campaign manager Annie  Ellison  . They are excited about Danny's campaign for new leadership. And we are really proud of that.  Balderson's campaign had a different take on O'Connor's haul.  Liberal out of state special interest groups are continuing to prop up Danny O'Connor's campaign in their efforts to retake the House and put Nancy Pelosi in the Speaker's chair, said a statement Balderson released through his campaign before his own report was filed. While O'Connor's campaign has raised 90% of his campaign funds from liberal out of staters, our campaign is funded by hard-working Ohioans who want someone who will fight for them and their middle class values.  O'Connor's campaign got more than $114,000 from political action committees, including $5,000 each from organizations associated with autoworkers, boilermakers and firefighters unions. He also got a $5,000 donation from a committee associated with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker and $2,000 from Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign committee.  The political committees that contributed to Balderson included Donald Trump's presidential campaign, which gave $2,000, and political committees associated with aspiring House of Representatives speakers Kevin McCarthy of California, who gave $4,000, and Jim Jordan of Champaign County, who gave $2,000. Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman's political committee gave $5,000 to Balderson, as did political action committees for Koch Industries, Murray Energy, and Cardinal Health.  O'Connor's campaign said Balderson's report demonstrated he's beholden to corporations and party bosses.  We're proud of the grassroots support behind Danny's campaign for new leadership because people are ready for someone who isn't beholden to any corporation or party boss, that's why he didn't take a single dime of corporate PAC money and 92% of contributions were for $50 or less, Ellison said. Central Ohioans get excited for new leadership when they hear from Danny, and with this grassroots army we'll have the resources to communicate his message.  O'Connor's biggest expenses were more than $2.6.million spent on media production and buys, and digital services. He felt financially secure enough to give a $25,000 contribution to the Ohio Democratic Party on Aug. 10.  Balderson's campaign spent more than $400,000 on media buys and more than $42,000 on fundraising services. He also paid the Republican National Committee $25,000 for a campaign event.  Records compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics indicated that outside groups spent more than $5 million so far to back Balderson and oppose O'Connor, while groups sympathetic to O'Connor have spent around $1.3 million.  My record of balancing budgets, cutting taxes, and delivering results are what Ohioans are looking for in a Congressman, as evidenced by my victory in the August special election, said a statement from Balderson. We will have the necessary resources to deliver that message and defend against any attacks from the O'Connor-Pelosi team.",partially false
31a6122b,Biden slammed after wrongly saying ‘we have over 120 million dead from COVID’,"Republicans are slamming Joe Biden after the presumptive Democratic nominee made a verbal gaffe during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania and said 120 million people had died from the novel coronavirus.  “People don’t have a job, people don’t know where to go, they don’t know what to do,” Biden said Thursday. “Now we have over 120 million dead from COVID.”  As of Thursday, there have been more than 122,000 – not million -- coronavirus deaths in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins figures.  While Biden appears to immediately catch himself after his gaffe -- the pool video of Biden’s comments cuts off after he made the remark – Republicans were quick to jump on the former vice president’s comment.  “WHAT IS GOING ON WITH JOE BIDEN?” Steve Guest, the Republican National Committee’s rapid response director, tweeted out with a link to the clip.  President Trump’s reelection campaign team went after Biden even harder – calling him “very confused” and dredging up one of Biden’s past gaffes when he said that 150 million Americans had died from gun violence since 2007.  “Joe Biden is very confused,” the campaign tweeted out. “He's not playing with a full deck, folks. #BarelyThereBiden.”  Biden was in Lancaster, Pa., to discuss unveil his healthcare proposals as his campaign revs up for more appearances after months indoors amid the coronavirus pandemic. His campaign has focused on small group gatherings to mitigate chances of spreading COVID-19 instead of large public rallies like Trump has begun to hold again.  NEW POLLS INDICATE TRUMP TRAILING BIDEN IN 6 KEY BATTLEGROUNDS  During his stop, Biden pushed the need to protect Affordable Care Act, or ObamaCare, while also taking shots at Trump’s recent comments on testing. Trump told a crowd at a rally over the weekend that he asked staff to slow down coronavirus testing.  “He called testing, quote, a double edge sword,” Biden said. “Let's be crystal clear about what he means by that. Testing unequivocally saves lives and widespread testing is the key to opening our economy. That's one edge of the sword. The other edge, he thinks that finding out that more Americans are sick will make him look bad.”  Biden added: “Donald Trump needs to stop caring about how he looks to start caring about what America has happened to the rest of America.”  CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP  Biden’s verbal slip-ups have plagued him throughout his 2020 presidential bid with the Trump campaign using them as fodder to argue that the presumptive Democratic nominee is unfit for the Oval Office, as well as to draw attention away from Trump’s own mistakes.  The president himself has been hammered by pundits and Democrats for false or misleading claims he’s made regarding the coronavirus pandemic – from his now infamous March 6 declaration that anybody that wants a test can get a test to claiming that the Obama administration had left him with bad or old tests for COVID-19 even though there could not have been a test until Trump's presidency.  Despite Biden’s slip-ups on the stump, his poll numbers against Trump continue to rise with a Real Clear Politics average showing the former vice president holding a 10 point lead over the current White House occupant with the general election less than five months away.",false
72d48555,"EXCLUSIVE: Proof China, Russia Hacked 2020 Election: IP Addresses In China, Russia, Hong Kong, Germany, Canada, Czech Republic Hacked PA, NV, MI, GA Battleground States Raw Data Analytics Show","By Mary Fanning and Alan Jones | January 11, 2021  Raw data analytics exclusively obtained by The American Report show that during the 2020 presidential election internet protocol IP addresses in China, Russia, Hong Kong, Germany, Canada, and the Czech Republic hacked into IP addresses in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Nevada, Michigan and Georgia.  IP addresses owned by Chinese telecom enterprise Huawei Cloud and Huawei’s headquarters hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3, 2020, the data analysis shows. A Huawei-owned IP address also hacked an IP address in Michigan.  IP addresses owned by Chinese state-owned telecommunications operator China Unicom also hacked into IP addresses in Pennsylvania on November 3.  IP addresses owned by Chinese internet provider ChinaNet hacked into IP addresses in Nevada on November 3, according to the data analysis.  Aliyun Computing Co. owns several IP addresses that hacked into IP addresses in Michigan on November 3, the data analysis shows. Aliyun, also known as Alibaba Cloud, “is the cloud computing unit of Alibaba Group,” according to TechCrunch.  Alibaba founder Jack Ma has not been seen for weeks.  An IP address owned by Kaspersky Lab – Moscow hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the data analysis. Kaspersky is a Russian software and cybersecurity firm. Kasperky Lab was co-founded by Eugene Kaspersky and his now-ex-wife, Natalya Kaspersky.  Eugene Kasperky, the CEO of Kaspersky Lab, served in the Soviet military intelligence service and is a graduate of The Technical Faculty of the KGB Higher School, now known as Institute of Cryptography, Telecommunications and Computer Science, part of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation, widely known as the FSB.  Natalya Kaspersky is now the CEO of Russia’s InfoWatch Group and has a reported net worth of $270 million. “Natalya Kaspersky’s Snoop-Proof Phone Helps Putin Thwart Spies,” according to Bloomberg.  President Trump banned Kaspersky from all U.S. government networks when he signed the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act NDAA. “The ban, included as part of a broader defense policy spending bill that Trump signed, reinforces a directive issued by the Trump administration in September that civilian agencies remove Kaspersky Lab software within 90 days,” Reuters reported on December 12, 2017. “The law applies to both civilian and military networks.” U.S. District Court Judge for the U.S. District of the District of Columbia Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, former Presiding Judge of the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court FISA Court, upheld President Trump’s ban after Kaspersky Labs sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  “Christopher Krebs, a senior cyber security official at the Department of Homeland Security, told reporters that nearly all government agencies had fully removed Kaspersky products from their networks in compliance with the September order,” according to the Reuters report. President Trump “terminated” Krebs in mid-November 2020 after Krebs claimed the 2020 election was the most secure election in history.  An IP address owned by the University of Stuttgart, a research university in Germany, also hacked into an IP address in Michigan on November 3, according to the analysis.  Amazon Data Services in Toronto, Canada owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the analysis.  Dominion Voting Services is based in Toronto. Amazon Web Services AWS is a major provider of cloud services for U.S. elections.  IP addresses owned by Seznam, a search engine based in the Czech Republic, as well as an IP address owned by O2 Czech Republic, a Czech company offering mobile communications and internet access services, hacked into IP addresses in Michigan on November 3, the analysis shows.  China’s Shanghai UCloud Information Technology Company Limited owns an IP address that hacked into a Michigan IP address on November 3, according to the data analysis.

e5e34f96,"Feds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses Made in China in Chicago O'Hare Airport","Nation  Feds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses Made in China in Chicago O'Hare Airport - ALL Registered to Vote -- ALL Democrat  Why are the Chinese making so many fake U.S. driver licenses? Why are they being shipped to Chicago's O'Hare Airport? Why are ALL the names completely phony; yet ALL are Registered to Vote . . . and Registered as Democrats?  That’s a disturbing little tidbit to discover, especially right before an election, right?  According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the bulk of these fake U.S. IDs flooding into the country come from China and Hong Kong, with the rest coming in from South Korea and the U.K.  Officials in Chicago just confiscated a shipment of these fake IDs totaling nearly 20 thousand.  Of course, the local news media in Chicago doesn’t see a connection to “voter fraud,” but most other people do.  As a matter of fact, it’s the main thing that most people see with just three months before an election.  What emboldens illegal voters more than to head to the polls with a phony ID in their pocket in case anyone asks for ID?  From Fox Five Federal customs officers have seized 1,513 shipments from overseas containing fraudulent documents—19,888 counterfeit U.S. driver’s licenses—just at Chicago O’Hare International Airport this year through the end of June. Most of the shipments came from Hong Kong and mainland China, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Other shipments came from South Korea and the U.K. “These counterfeit driver’s licenses can lead to disastrous consequences,” CBP’s Ralph Piccirilli said in a statement. “Criminal organizations use these counterfeit IDs to avoid attracting attention to their illegal activities.” […] “What is most disconcerting about these interceptions, besides the volume in which we are experiencing, is the ease in which so many young people freely share their personal information with counterfeiters abroad,” Lemaux said in a statement. “We’ll continue to collaborate with local law enforcement to educate the public, and anyone who is contemplating purchasing a counterfeit ID online, on the potential dangers of sharing your personal, identifiable information with a criminal element.”  These, they caught.    Makes you wonder how many slipped through the cracks?  Oh, and how is it that that ALL of these phony names are ALL registered to vote and ALL registered as Democrats?  HAL TURNER COMMENTARY  I think that we need to really think outside of the box and be open to *anything* in terms of cheating or interference, because the Dems simply can’t lose this election, and they’ll work with anyone, anywhere to help squeak out a victory.  And I think China is the number one culprit we need to keep our eyes on.  This is literally China Collusion with the Democrats. But because it's the left-wing doing this, the mass-media won't utter as much as a peep.

1abdbb0e,Doctors are ordered to ask patients if they are gay,"Every patient visiting their family doctor or attending a hospital appointment in England will be asked to declare if they are gay, straight or bisexual under controversial new rules imposed by the NHS.  The astonishing diktat – condemned last night as ‘intrusive’ and ‘insulting’ – orders doctors to include details of a patient’s sexuality on their permanent medical record for the first time.  An official NHS directive, seen by The Mail on Sunday, reveals that from April 2019 all patients aged 16 or over will face questioning about their sexual identity.  NHS England last night refused to give details about how the highly personal information will be collected – leading to fears patients could be quizzed by GPs, nurses and even receptionists.  Scroll down for video  Every patient visiting their family doctor or attending a hospital appointment in England will be asked to declare if they are gay, straight or bisexual under controversial new rules file photo  Its instructions, published last week, say that ‘sexual orientation monitoring’ should take place ‘at every face-to-face contact with the patient, where no record of this data exists’.  The directions suggest patients could be asked the highly personal question regularly if the records are not properly shared between different parts of the NHS as patients attend GP appointments, A&E, outpatients or even antenatal classes.  There are also fears about the security of the data, as any leak could potentially ‘out’ thousands of patients.  Health chiefs say NHS organisations and councils must ask so that they can obtain better data on the health of gay and bisexual people throughout England.  Failing to do so risks breaking the Equality Act 2010, gay rights groups have warned.  But last night politicians and doctors said the NHS had ‘no place’ asking all patients the question.  Former Labour Minister Graham Stringer, MP for Blackley and Broughton, said: ‘Unless it’s related to your health, your sexuality is not the NHS’s business.’  And Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It sounds intrusive and Orwellian.’  Never before has the State insisted citizens face a question about their sexual identity. The Office for National Statistics considered including it in the 2011 census but decided against due to ‘concerns about the quality and accuracy of data... and issues of acceptability to respondents’.  The astonishing diktat – condemned as ‘intrusive’ and ‘insulting’ – orders doctors to include details of a patient’s sexuality on their permanent medical record for the first time file photo  People over 16 will be asked: ‘Which of the following best describes how you think of yourself?’ They can say they are ‘straight’, ‘gay or lesbian’, ‘bisexual’ or ‘other’.  They will also be able to state that they are ‘not sure’ of their sexuality, or ‘decline to provide a response’. But whatever answer they give – including if they refuse to divulge their sexuality – will be noted on their medical record for ever.  Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said: ‘I think it’s a confounded cheek to ask GPs to do this. It really is not the place of family doctors, to start monitoring people’s sexuality.  ‘We are at risk of becoming state apparatchiks, asking questions about patients’ sexuality, housing, whether they can cook, or do crochet! When someone comes in for their precious eight minutes with me, I’m interested in what they want from the consultation.  ‘It isn’t relevant to ask an 87-year-old grandmother if she has ever had a relationship with another woman. She would find that incredibly insulting and storm out. It would ruin the consultation.’  The project is being launched – without full public consultation –after at least seven years’ lobbying by the LGBT Foundation.  NHS England said the Manchester-based gay rights charity had ‘led the work to develop’ the so-called ‘sexual orientation monitoring information standard’ – the framework under which ‘all patients/service users aged 16 and over across all health services and local authorities’ will be quizzed about their sexuality.  The document, bearing the logos of both organisations, says there is ‘strong evidence’ that lesbian, gay and bisexual [LGB] people are ‘disproportionately affected’ by sexually transmitted infections, substance abuse, poor mental health and loneliness in old age.  More data would enable NHS and social care bosses to ‘better understand, respond to and improve LGB patients’ service access, outcomes and experience’ and allow ‘targeted prevention and early intervention’ work to improve their health.  The Equality Act 2010 contains a legal obligation for all public sector bodies to pay ‘due regard’ to the needs of lesbian, gay and bisexual people’ to ensure they are not discriminated against.  Collecting and analysing data on sexual orientation would be ‘evidence of compliance’ for health and social care providers, the document adds.  Dr Ian Banks, former president of the Men’s Health Forum, said in an ‘ideal world’ it would be good to have ‘big data’ about patients’ sexuality to improve health services. But he warned: ‘Some people don’t want others to know their sexuality. It’s up to them – it’s not up to NHS England to know, or the GP to ask.’  Many justifiably feared that a data breach, or request from an insurance company, could mean details of their sexuality being made public.  In March, the Information Commissioner announced it was investigating fears that medical records held by 2,700 GP practices – a third of those in England – were not secure and could be read by workers including clerical staff. Changes have since been made.  ‘People don’t believe that their notes are going to stay confidential,’ Dr Banks said. ‘Once it’s down on our medical notes, that’s it – you can’t get rid of it. And then it goes out to numerous databases.’  Those who refused to state their sexuality could face uncomfortable questions about why, he added.  In a statement, NHS England said: ‘All health bodies and local authorities with responsibility for adult social care are required under the Equality Act to ensure that no patient is discriminated against.  ‘This information standard is designed to help NHS bodies be compliant with the law by consistently collecting, only where relevant, personal details of patients such as race, sex and sexual orientation. They do not have to do it in every area, people do not have to answer the questions and it will have no impact on the care they receive.’",partially false
3c2b01de,The Government Has Released Their Initial Plans To Force a Vaccine on EVERYONE,"Earlier today, the Trump administration released its plans to vaccine everyone in a short time. Three potential vaccines are currently in Stage 3 trials in the United States and could be ready in weeks, President Donald Trump said Tuesday.  Time is running out. And Trump has the military lined up and ready to distribute this vaccine to the public, whether you want it or not. The plan is to distribute the vaccine first to health care and other vital workers, as well as those most vulnerable likely the older populations. After production ramps up, it will be made available to all Americans who want it. If you decide you don’t want it, don’t worry, the military will help convince you.  The Department of Defense and federal health agencies have outlined plans for a coronavirus vaccine, which includes having them available for free for all Americans. We have warned that the DoD is about to become the enemy of the public. Instead of committing terrorism abroad, they will be going that here. Prepare yourself.  The Pentagon & CDC Will Join Together To Mass Distribute The COVID Vaccine  This toxic concoction will also be “free.” The government says they will foot the bill borrow money from the Federal Reserve to get everyone vaccinated, according to the Watauga Democrat.  “Preparing for the implementation of the safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine programs is a critical next step in the efforts to protect Americans and reduce the impact of COVID-19 and restore our normal way of life,” Centers for Disease Control and Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Wednesday, according to CNN.  The plans came in the form of a report to Congress and a “playbook” for states and local governments, according to the Associated Press and Fox News. The agencies are looking at January for a potential beginning of a vaccination campaign, although it remains possible that this could come later this year.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s playbook, the vaccination campaign will be “much larger in scope and complexity than seasonal influenza or other previous outbreak-related vaccination responses.”  President Trump said in a “Fox & Friends” interview Tuesday that a vaccine could be approved “in a matter of weeks.”  Time is almost up. Once this vaccine gets into your bloodstream, you cannot take it back out. This one is different from every other vaccine made, and it’s going to be necessary if you want to get groceries or leave your house. Mandatory or not, they will do what they can to convince you to take this vaccine.  Stay alert and be prepared.

acd85167,Pelosi Has 100-Year-Old Ten Commandments Monument Removed from Capitol,"Nancy Pelosi has stooped to a new low. This time, attacking a 100-year-old monument devoted to the 10 commandments that has been in the lobby of the capitol building for nearly a century.  Work crews showed up and made quick work, rolling the monument out and down the ramp for disabled people.  Pelosi had this to say about the removal:  “It’s long overdue that we make a separation between church and state. Non-Christians should not be forced to read the 10 commandments while walking into their capitol. God doesn’t belong here.”  God doesn’t belong here? Those are fighting words.  More than ever, it’s clear that God is needed in our government. Our lawmakers need to be reminded of who is actually in charge. We should have biblical laws on the books. Husbands should be able to sell their wives to settle debts. Women should be silent. Lethal force should only be permitted after darkness. And, if a woman interferes in a fight between two men by grabbing her husband’s opponent’s privates, her hand should be cut off.  We need to get back to these biblical basics. Removing an ancient monument should be the furthest thing from Pelosi’s agenda.  But, of course, it’s not.  Joe Barron, the representative for the organization, Put God Everywhere says:  “We will fight this every step of the way. The first step was to get in front of the monument as they were rolling it out and try to stop it. Unfortunately, it was just too heavy to stop. We will continue this tug-o-war for months and have no doubt we will be victorious. The monument WILL be placed back in the Capitol when we are finished!”  As God would want it. We are sure.",false
ae596f59,The New York Times Affirms: ‘Soros & Clinton Paid Woman To Accuse Trump Of Sexual Attack’,"A Proof has recently appeared that cash attached to Hillary Clinton and George Soros was utilized to pay ladies to make-up false claims that President Trump sexually attacked them, as per a report in the New York Times.  Writing for TheHill, analytical columnist John Solomon, uncovers that payouts were made by lawyer Lisa Bloom to ladies who were willing to lie and act in public that they were sexually attacked by now President Donald Trump. The cash was attractive, so they decided to do it.  As indicated by the report, one of the accusers had the mortgage on her home paid off, while the other was offered cash amount of $750,000.  The names of two of were uncovered by the NY Times and both are attached to the evilness. Guess who? George Soros and Hillary Clinton.  Right after that, it was uncovered that Soros invested an astounding $3 million into the New York Times by taking up a lot of the organization’s stocks.  Could this action be a method for controlling the publication’s account on such stories on in the near future? Well of course!  The New York Times named David Brock, a George Soros partner in crime, and Clinton’s long-term companion Susie Tompkins Buell, who controlled countless dollars in order to fight Trump’s campaign before the presidential election.  David Brock not just has connections to Hillary Clinton and George Soros, he is the Resistance, not exclusively to Trump however to Fox News also.  That’s the story of our country folks… Soros and the Democratic Party spending millions of dollars to oppose Trump and the good of our nation. Why they are doing this? It’s more than obvious!

bc6d5d55,Arm Yourselves and Prepare; China Massing Tens-of-Thousands of Troops in Prince Rupert and Vancouver Canada. Invade USA? ,"Under a Treaty signed in late 2019 with Canada, the People's Liberation Army of China has been quietly massing military troops in Canada since the beginning of 2020 and those troops are believed to be readying for an actual military invasion of the United States.  While it has long been rumored that China began massing troops and armor in southern Mexico for a similar invasion goal, word of such troops appearing in Canada only began this year. Those rumors were pretty much laughed off until video emerged this week of Chinese troops on a back road of Salt Spring Island, near Vancouver, British Columbia.  Here is that 35 second video:  Once actual proof emerged of Chinese troops in Canada, we started digging into where they were in relation to US soil and how such a thing could be; given that Canada was _supposed_ to be a U.S. ally?   The map below shows where China is massing the troops in Prince Rupert and on Salt Spring Island, BC, CANADA:  It turns out that the globalist/Commie Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, signed a Treaty with China in late 2019.  In January, 2020, the Canadian Independent Press Review reported it as follows:  Under the terms of the Foreign Investment Protection Act FIPA, a bi-lateral treaty ratified with China by the Trudeau government in 2019, Chinese security forces can be stationed on Canadian soil to protect vital Chinese investments, without the knowledge or consent of local authorities.                    – Canadian Independent Press Review, January 15, 2020  One has to ask why Prime Minister Trudeau would sign such a treaty?  Does Canada not have its own military to protect vital Chinese investments?   Does Canada not trust its own Royal Canadian Mounted Police?  Are Canada's Provincial Police forces somehow inadequate?  Or did Prime Minister Trudeau somehow find that allowing China to mass troops in his country might be beneficial to HIMSELF?  Did Trudeau get a massive payoff from China to betray the United States like this?  What other explanation could there be?  According to locals in British Columbia, PLA troops are troops being stationed in Stanley Park almost an entire island of a park in Vancouver, as temporary housing until they are assigned something permanent.  Look at the size of this park:  Oh, and get this . . .Canadians say THEY CANNOT GO INTO THAT PARK because it is taken over by China's People's Liberation Army!   Anyone trying to enter the park is stopped by Vancouver police and refused entry unless they are PLA troops!  One Canadian tells me “You got ‘em PLA Troops all over the coast, man, based outta Prince Rupert. A bunch of their military intel people work outta their consulate in town Vancouver and they can airlift the assault troops here in an hour, is what I been told.”  That same source went on to say That’s how that fucking traitor Trudeau’s arranged it with Beijing, man. The west coast is theirs. They’re gonna be the ones managing the curfews and all the other shit that’s gonna follow.   So, ladies and gentlemen, our neighbor and ally, Canada, under the completely fraudulent guise of protecting Chinese investments, has betrayed the United States and is permitting China to mass troops on Canada's west coast, and China is doing so - allegedly to protect their investments - but in actual fact, for use in attacking and conquering the United States.     REDEPLOYMENT OF F-22's AND F-35's to . . .  Alaska  There was a curious story a few weeks ago about how the US is redeploying F-22's and F-35's to . . . Alaska. Story Here   It didn't make any sense at the time.  Why would we put some of our most advanced fighter jets all the way up there?   Now, we seem to know!   The US Government knows what China is doing and our government is preparing to fight them off!  Those planes can fly in from behind the Chinese troops and bomb them.     CALL-UP of ONE MILLION RESERVISTS  There was another story back in March, by ABC News HERE about President Trump authorizing the Secretary of Defense to Call-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists.  At the time, we were told that the call-up had to do with COVID-19 and those troops would be able to help with the outbreak.     That story just didn't hold water because the COVID outbreak wasn't nearly that bad.  Now, the call-up seems to make sense.  The US Government saw that China has begun massing troops and is calling-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists to fight them off!     West Coast Wild Fires to chase population away?  For months, the US west coast has been seeing ferocious wildfires that have burned millions of acres, and destroyed tens-of-thousands of homes.  Just two weeks ago, earthquake guru Dutch Since accidentally stumbled upon what appear to be Directed Energy Weapons being used to start and spread those fires!  His video showed that US Satellites in space which monitor environmental conditions in the USA, picked up literal beams in the Near-infra-red spectrum, being fired at and into the wildfires.   Here's a screen shot of such beams being fired:  When those beams hit, the fires immediately grew in intensity, and spread.  Other photos - VERY MANY - have been taken by citizens on the scenes as these beams were fired and they were so shocked at seeing it, the people too photos of the beams as they took place:  Here's a slew of others: Click image to enlarge  Then, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, revealed to the American people that China and Russia have weaponized space and he specifically mentioned Directed Energy Weapons in his address to an Air Force conference.  In just the first TWO MINUTES, the Secretary of Defense repeatedly tells us that China and Russia are employing Asymmetric capabilities and he flatly states they have weaponized space with Directed Energy Weapons.  Just watch the first two minutes:  I'm sure all of you at some time or another have seen a car fire.   They get to burning pretty ferociously, right?  When have you EVER seen a car fire that causes the wheels to actually melt?  Take a look at what's been happening in the US west coast . . .  Vehicles are being MELTED in the so-called wild fires.  How can burning wood melt steel?  It can't.  The burn temperature doesn't get hot enough.   But a directed energy weapon could do it . . . and now, it looks as though that's precisely what's been happening!  But why?  Why would China want to start massive fires on our west coast?  Simple: To chase the people out.  The world knows that American citizens are ARMED to the teeth thanks to our Constitution's Second Amendment.  Famously, back in World War 2 after their attack upon Pearl Harbor, a Japanese General remarked that Americans were so heavily armed that Japan would face a gun behind every blade of grass if they ever tried to invade.  That, he said, was why Japan never invaded.  China knows this too.  So they're burning us out!   They're starting these fires to get rid of literally millions of Americans so Chinese troops WON'T face a gun behind every blade of grass.   These fires are softening-up the west coast for invasion!     UPDATE 10:12 PM EDT --  HEADS UP! DURING THIS MORNINGS INTERVIEW WITH MARIA BARTIROMO, PRESDENT TRUMP SAID... I HAVE BEEN BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME, WE NEED TO HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME FOR RUSSIA AND CHINA.     Why isn't Congress doing anything to defend us?  Where is a Declaration of war?   We've been under attack by directed energy weapons for months. It's time to attack back.  Americans are URGED to arm themselves and prepare.  Invading foreign army persons are to be shown NO QUARTER and NO MERCY.  Take no prisoners.   This is going to be a fight for our very existence.      SURVEIL THEM!

31d33510,COVID19 PCR Tests are Scientifically Meaningless,"Though the whole world relies on RT-PCR to “diagnose” Sars-Cov-2 infection, the science is clear: they are not fit for purpose  Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter  Lockdowns and hygienic measures around the world are based on numbers of cases and mortality rates created by the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests used to identify “positive” patients, whereby “positive” is usually equated with “infected.”  But looking closely at the facts, the conclusion is that these PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2.  Unfounded “Test, test, test,…” mantra  At the media briefing on COVID-19 on March 16, 2020, the WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said:  We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.”  The message was spread through headlines around the world, for instance by Reuters and the BBC.  Still on the 3 of May, the moderator of the heute journal — one of the most important news magazines on German television— was passing the mantra of the corona dogma on to his audience with the admonishing words:  Test, test, test—that is the credo at the moment, and it is the only way to really understand how much the coronavirus is spreading.”  This indicates that the belief in the validity of the PCR tests is so strong that it equals a religion that tolerates virtually no contradiction.  But it is well known that religions are about faith and not about scientific facts. And as Walter Lippmann, the two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and perhaps the most influential journalist of the 20th century said: “Where all think alike, no one thinks very much.”  So to start, it is very remarkable that Kary Mullis himself, the inventor of the Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR technology, did not think alike. His invention got him the Nobel prize in chemistry in 1993.  Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year at the age of 74, but there is no doubt that the biochemist regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection.  The reason is that the intended use of the PCR was, and still is, to apply it as a manufacturing technique, being able to replicate DNA sequences millions and billions of times, and not as a diagnostic tool to detect viruses.  How declaring virus pandemics based on PCR tests can end in disaster was described by Gina Kolata in her 2007 New York Times article Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn’t.  Lack of a valid gold standard  Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the PCR tests used to identify so-called COVID-19 patients presumably infected by what is called SARS-CoV-2 do not have a valid gold standard to compare them with.  This is a fundamental point. Tests need to be evaluated to determine their preciseness — strictly speaking their “sensitivity”[1] and “specificity” — by comparison with a “gold standard,” meaning the most accurate method available.  As an example, for a pregnancy test the gold standard would be the pregnancy itself. But as Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, for example, stated in an ABC TV interview in an answer to the question “How accurate is the [COVID-19] testing?”:  If we had a new test for picking up [the bacterium] golden staph in blood, we’ve already got blood cultures, that’s our gold standard we’ve been using for decades, and we could match this new test against that. But for COVID-19 we don’t have a gold standard test.”  Jessica C. Watson from Bristol University confirms this. In her paper “Interpreting a COVID-19 test result”, published recently in The British Medical Journal, she writes that there is a “lack of such a clear-cut ‘gold-standard’ for COVID-19 testing.”  But instead of classifying the tests as unsuitable for SARS-CoV-2 detection and COVID-19 diagnosis, or instead of pointing out that only a virus, proven through isolation and purification, can be a solid gold standard, Watson claims in all seriousness that, “pragmatically” COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, “may be the best available ‘gold standard’.” But this is not scientifically sound.  Apart from the fact that it is downright absurd to take the PCR test itself as part of the gold standard to evaluate the PCR test, there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, as even people such as Thomas Löscher, former head of the Department of Infection and Tropical Medicine at the University of Munich and member of the Federal Association of German Internists, conceded to us[2].  And if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis — contrary to Watson’s statement — cannot be suitable for serving as a valid gold standard.  In addition, “experts” such as Watson overlook the fact that only virus isolation, i.e. an unequivocal virus proof, can be the gold standard.  That is why I asked Watson how COVID-19 diagnosis “may be the best available gold standard,” if there are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19, and also whether the virus itself, that is virus isolation, wouldn’t be the best available/possible gold standard. But she hasn’t answered these questions yet – despite multiple requests. And she has not yet responded to our rapid response post on her article in which we address exactly the same points, either, though she wrote us on June 2nd: “I will try to post a reply later this week when I have a chance.”  No proof for the RNA being of viral origin  Now the question is: What is required first for virus isolation/proof? We need to know where the RNA for which the PCR tests are calibrated comes from.  As textbooks e.g., White/Fenner. Medical Virology, 1986, p. 9 as well as leading virus researchers such as Luc Montagnier or Dominic Dwyer state, particle purification — i.e. the separation of an object from everything else that is not that object, as for instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg of radium chloride in 1898 by extracting it from tons of pitchblende — is an essential pre-requisite for proving the existence of a virus, and thus to prove that the RNA from the particle in question comes from a new virus.  The reason for this is that PCR is extremely sensitive, which means it can detect even the smallest pieces of DNA or RNA — but it cannot determine where these particles came from. That has to be determined beforehand.  And because the PCR tests are calibrated for gene sequences in this case RNA sequences because SARS-CoV-2 is believed to be a RNA virus, we have to know that these gene snippets are part of the looked-for virus. And to know that, correct isolation and purification of the presumed virus has to be executed.  Hence, we have asked the science teams of the relevant papers which are referred to in the context of SARS-CoV-2 for proof whether the electron-microscopic shots depicted in their in vitro experiments show purified viruses.  But not a single team could answer that question with “yes” — and NB., nobody said purification was not a necessary step. We only got answers like “No, we did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification” see below.  We asked several study authors “Do your electron micrographs show the purified virus?”, they gave the following responses:  Study 1: Leo L. M. Poon; Malik Peiris. “Emergence of a novel human coronavirus threatening human health” Nature Medicine, March 2020  Replying Author: Malik Peiris  Date: May 12, 2020  Answer: “The image is the virus budding from an infected cell. It is not purified virus.” Study 2: Myung-Guk Han et al. “Identification of Coronavirus Isolated from a Patient in Korea with COVID-19”, Osong Public Health and Research Perspectives, February 2020  Replying Author: Myung-Guk Han  Date: May 6, 2020  Answer: “We could not estimate the degree of purification because we do not purify and concentrate the virus cultured in cells.” Study 3: Wan Beom Park et al. “Virus Isolation from the First Patient with SARS-CoV-2 in Korea”, Journal of Korean Medical Science, February 24, 2020  Replying Author: Wan Beom Park  Date: March 19, 2020  Answer: “We did not obtain an electron micrograph showing the degree of purification.” Study 4: Na Zhu et al., “A Novel Coronavirus from Patients with Pneumonia in China”, 2019, New England Journal of Medicine, February 20, 2020  Replying Author: Wenjie Tan  Date: March 18, 2020  Answer: “[We show] an image of sedimented virus particles, not purified ones.”  Regarding the mentioned papers it is clear that what is shown in the electron micrographs EMs is the end result of the experiment, meaning there is no other result that they could have made EMs from.  That is to say, if the authors of these studies concede that their published EMs do not show purified particles, then they definitely do not possess purified particles claimed to be viral. In this context, it has to be remarked that some researchers use the term “isolation” in their papers, but the procedures described therein do not represent a proper isolation purification process. Consequently, in this context the term “isolation” is misused.  Thus, the authors of four of the principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery of a new coronavirus concede they had no proof that the origin of the virus genome was viral-like particles or cellular debris, pure or impure, or particles of any kind. In other words, the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.  We have also contacted Dr Charles Calisher, who is a seasoned virologist. In 2001, Science published an “impassioned plea…to the younger generation” from several veteran virologists, among them Calisher, saying that:  [modern virus detection methods like] sleek polymerase chain reaction […] tell little or nothing about how a virus multiplies, which animals carry it, [or] how it makes people sick. [It is] like trying to say whether somebody has bad breath by looking at his fingerprint.”[3]  And that’s why we asked Dr Calisher whether he knows one single paper in which SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated and finally really purified. His answer:  I know of no such a publication. I have kept an eye out for one.”[4]  This actually means that one cannot conclude that the RNA gene sequences, which the scientists took from the tissue samples prepared in the mentioned in vitro trials and for which the PCR tests are finally being “calibrated,” belong to a specific virus — in this case SARS-CoV-2.  In addition, there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.  In order to establish a causal connection, one way or the other, i.e. beyond virus isolation and purification, it would have been absolutely necessary to carry out an experiment that satisfies the four Koch’s postulates. But there is no such experiment, as Amory Devereux and Rosemary Frei recently revealed for OffGuardian.  The necessity to fulfill these postulates regarding SARS-CoV-2 is demonstrated not least by the fact that attempts have been made to fulfill them. But even researchers claiming they have done it, in reality, did not succeed.  One example is a study published in Nature on May 7. This trial, besides other procedures which render the study invalid, did not meet any of the postulates.  For instance, the alleged “infected” laboratory mice did not show any relevant clinical symptoms clearly attributable to pneumonia, which according to the third postulate should actually occur if a dangerous and potentially deadly virus was really at work there. And the slight bristles and weight loss, which were observed temporarily in the animals are negligible, not only because they could have been caused by the procedure itself, but also because the weight went back to normal again.  Also, no animal died except those they killed to perform the autopsies. And let’s not forget: These experiments should have been done before developing a test, which is not the case.  Revealingly, none of the leading German representatives of the official theory about SARS-Cov-2/COVID-19 — the Robert Koch-Institute RKI, Alexander S. Kekulé University of Halle, Hartmut Hengel and Ralf Bartenschlager German Society for Virology, the aforementioned Thomas Löscher, Ulrich Dirnagl Charité Berlin or Georg Bornkamm virologist and professor emeritus at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Munich — could answer the following question I have sent them:  If the particles that are claimed to be to be SARS-CoV-2 have not been purified, how do you want to be sure that the RNA gene sequences of these particles belong to a specific new virus?  Particularly, if there are studies showing that substances such as antibiotics that are added to the test tubes in the in vitro experiments carried out for virus detection can “stress” the cell culture in a way that new gene sequences are being formed that were not previously detectable — an aspect that Nobel laureate Barbara McClintock already drew attention to in her Nobel Lecture back in 1983.  It should not go unmentioned that we finally got the Charité – the employer of Christian Drosten, Germany’s most influential virologist in respect of COVID-19, advisor to the German government and co-developer of the PCR test which was the first to be “accepted” not validated! by the WHO worldwide – to answer questions on the topic.  But we didn’t get answers until June 18, 2020, after months of non-response. In the end, we achieved it only with the help of Berlin lawyer Viviane Fischer.  Regarding our question “Has the Charité convinced itself that appropriate particle purification was carried out?,” the Charité concedes that they didn’t use purified particles.  And although they claim “virologists at the Charité are sure that they are testing for the virus,” in their paper Corman et al. they state:  RNA was extracted from clinical samples with the MagNA Pure 96 system Roche, Penzberg, Germany and from cell culture supernatants with the viral RNA mini kit QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany,”  Which means they just assumed the RNA was viral.  Incidentally, the Corman et al. paper, published on January 23, 2020 didn’t even go through a proper peer review process, nor were the procedures outlined therein accompanied by controls — although it is only through these two things that scientific work becomes really solid.  Irrational test results  It is also certain that we cannot know the false positive rate of the PCR tests without widespread testing of people who certainly do not have the virus, proven by a method which is independent of the test having a solid gold standard.  Therefore, it is hardly surprising that there are several papers illustrating irrational test results.  For example, already in February the health authority in China’s Guangdong province reported that people have fully recovered from illness blamed on COVID-19, started to test “negative,” and then tested “positive” again.  A month later, a paper published in the Journal of Medical Virology showed that 29 out of 610 patients at a hospital in Wuhan had 3 to 6 test results that flipped between “negative”, “positive” and “dubious”.  A third example is a study from Singapore in which tests were carried out almost daily on 18 patients and the majority went from “positive” to “negative” back to “positive” at least once, and up to five times in one patient.  Even Wang Chen, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, conceded in February that the PCR tests are “only 30 to 50 per cent accurate”; while Sin Hang Lee from the Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent a letter to the WHO’s coronavirus response team and to Anthony S. Fauci on March 22, 2020, saying that:  It has been widely reported in the social media that the RT-qPCR [Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR] test kits used to detect SARSCoV-2 RNA in human specimens are generating many false positive results and are not sensitive enough to detect some real positive cases.”  In other words, even if we theoretically assume that these PCR tests can really detect a viral infection, the tests would be practically worthless, and would only cause an unfounded scare among the “positive” people tested.  This becomes also evident considering the positive predictive value PPV.  The PPV indicates the probability that a person with a positive test result is truly “positive” ie. has the supposed virus, and it depends on two factors: the prevalence of the virus in the general population and the specificity of the test, that is the percentage of people without disease in whom the test is correctly “negative” a test with a specificity of 95% incorrectly gives a positive result in 5 out of 100 non-infected people.  With the same specificity, the higher the prevalence, the higher the PPV.  In this context, on June 12 2020, the journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt published an article in which the PPV has been calculated with three different prevalence scenarios.  The results must, of course, be viewed very critically, first because it is not possible to calculate the specificity without a solid gold standard, as outlined, and second because the calculations in the article are based on the specificity determined in the study by Jessica Watson, which is potentially worthless, as also mentioned.  But if you abstract from it, assuming that the underlying specificity of 95% is correct and that we know the prevalence, even the mainstream medical journal Deutsches Ärzteblatt reports that the so-called SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests may have “a shockingly low” PPV.  In one of the three scenarios, figuring with an assumed prevalence of 3%, the PPV was only 30 percent, which means that 70 percent of the people tested “positive” are not “positive” at all. Yet “they are prescribed quarantine,” as even the Ärzteblatt notes critically.  In a second scenario of the journal’s article, a prevalence of rate of 20 percent is assumed. In this case they generate a PPV of 78 percent, meaning that 22 percent of the “positive” tests are false “positives.”  That would mean: If we take the around 9 million people who are currently considered “positive” worldwide — supposing that the true “positives” really have a viral infection — we would get almost 2 million false “positives.”  All this fits with the fact that the CDC and the FDA, for instance, concede in their files that the so-called “SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests” are not suitable for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis.  In the “CDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel“ file from March 30, 2020, for example, it says:  Detection of viral RNA may not indicate the presence of infectious virus or that 2019-nCoV is the causative agent for clinical symptoms”  And:  This test cannot rule out diseases caused by other bacterial or viral pathogens.”  And the FDA admits that:  positive results […] do not rule out bacterial infection or co-infection with other viruses. The agent detected may not be the definite cause of disease.”  Remarkably, in the instruction manuals of PCR tests we can also read that they are not intended as a diagnostic test, as for instance in those by Altona Diagnostics and Creative Diagnostics[5].  To quote another one, in the product announcement of the LightMix Modular Assays produced by TIB Molbiol — which were developed using the Corman et al. protocol — and distributed by Roche we can read:  These assays are not intended for use as an aid in the diagnosis of coronavirus infection”  And:  For research use only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.”  Where is the evidence that the tests can measure the “viral load”?  There is also reason to conclude that the PCR test from Roche and others cannot even detect the targeted genes.  Moreover, in the product descriptions of the RT-qPCR tests for SARS-COV-2 it says they are “qualitative” tests, contrary to the fact that the “q” in “qPCR” stands for “quantitative.” And if these tests are not “quantitative” tests, they don’t show how many viral particles are in the body.  That is crucial because, in order to even begin talking about actual illness in the real world not only in a laboratory, the patient would need to have millions and millions of viral particles actively replicating in their body.  That is to say, the CDC, the WHO, the FDA or the RKI may assert that the tests can measure the so-called “viral load,” i.e. how many viral particles are in the body. “But this has never been proven. That is an enormous scandal,” as the journalist Jon Rappoport points out.  This is not only because the term “viral load” is deception. If you put the question “what is viral load?” at a dinner party, people take it to mean viruses circulating in the bloodstream. They’re surprised to learn it’s actually RNA molecules.  Also, to prove beyond any doubt that the PCR can measure how much a person is “burdened” with a disease-causing virus, the following experiment would have had to be carried out which has not yet happened:  You take, let’s say, a few hundred or even thousand people and remove tissue samples from them. Make sure the people who take the samples do not perform the test.The testers will never know who the patients are and what condition they’re in. The testers run their PCR on the tissue samples. In each case, they say which virus they found and how much of it they found. Then, for example, in patients 29, 86, 199, 272, and 293 they found a great deal of what they claim is a virus. Now we un-blind those patients. They should all be sick, because they have so much virus replicating in their bodies. But are they really sick — or are they fit as a fiddle?  With the help of the aforementioned lawyer Viviane Fischer, I finally got the Charité to also answer the question of whether the test developed by Corman et al. — the so-called “Drosten PCR test” — is a quantitative test.  But the Charité was not willing to answer this question “yes”. Instead, the Charité wrote:  If real-time RT-PCR is involved, to the knowledge of the Charité in most cases these are […] limited to qualitative detection.”  Furthermore, the “Drosten PCR test” uses the unspecific E-gene assay as preliminary assay, while the Institut Pasteur uses the same assay as confirmatory assay.  According to Corman et al., the E-gene assay is likely to detect all Asian viruses, while the other assays in both tests are supposed to be more specific for sequences labelled “SARS-CoV-2”.  Besides the questionable purpose of having either a preliminary or a confirmatory test that is likely to detect all Asian viruses, at the beginning of April the WHO changed the algorithm, recommending that from then on a test can be regarded as “positive” even if just the E-gene assay which is likely to detect all Asian viruses! gives a “positive” result.  This means that a confirmed unspecific test result is officially sold as specific.  That change of algorithm increased the “case” numbers. Tests using the E-gene assay are produced for example by Roche, TIB Molbiol and R-Biopharm.  High Cq values make the test results even more meaningless  Another essential problem is that many PCR tests have a “cycle quantification” Cq value of over 35, and some, including the “Drosten PCR test”, even have a Cq of 45.  The Cq value specifies how many cycles of DNA replication are required to detect a real signal from biological samples.  “Cq values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” as it says in the MIQE guidelines.  MIQE stands for “Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments”, a set of guidelines that describe the minimum information necessary for evaluating publications on Real-Time PCR, also called quantitative PCR, or qPCR.  The inventor himself, Kary Mullis, agreed, when he stated:  If you have to go more than 40 cycles to amplify a single-copy gene, there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”  The MIQE guidelines have been developed under the aegis of Stephen A. Bustin, Professor of Molecular Medicine, a world-renowned expert on quantitative PCR and author of the book A-Z of Quantitative PCR which has been called “the bible of qPCR.”  In a recent podcast interview Bustin points out that “the use of such arbitrary Cq cut-offs is not ideal, because they may be either too low eliminating valid results or too high increasing false “positive” results.”  And, according to him, a Cq in the 20s to 30s should be aimed at and there is concern regarding the reliability of the results for any Cq over 35.  If the Cq value gets too high, it becomes difficult to distinguish real signal from background, for example due to reactions of primers and fluorescent probes, and hence there is a higher probability of false positives.  Moreover, among other factors that can alter the result, before starting with the actual PCR, in case you are looking for presumed RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, the RNA must be converted to complementary DNA cDNA with the enzyme Reverse Transcriptase—hence the “RT” at the beginning of “PCR” or “qPCR.”  But this transformation process is “widely recognized as inefficient and variable,” as Jessica Schwaber from the Centre for Commercialization of Regenerative Medicine in Toronto and two research colleagues pointed out in a 2019 paper.  Stephen A. Bustin acknowledges problems with PCR in a comparable way.  For example, he pointed to the problem that in the course of the conversion process RNA to cDNA the amount of DNA obtained with the same RNA base material can vary widely, even by a factor of 10 see above interview.  Considering that the DNA sequences get doubled at every cycle, even a slight variation becomes magnified and can thus alter the result, annihilating the test’s reliable informative value.  So how can it be that those who claim the PCR tests are highly meaningful for so-called COVID-19 diagnosis blind out the fundamental inadequacies of these tests—even if they are confronted with questions regarding their validity?  Certainly, the apologists of the novel coronavirus hypothesis should have dealt with these questions before throwing the tests on the market and putting basically the whole world under lockdown, not least because these are questions that come to mind immediately for anyone with even a spark of scientific understanding.  Thus, the thought inevitably emerges that financial and political interests play a decisive role for this ignorance about scientific obligations. NB, the WHO, for example has financial ties with drug companies, as the British Medical Journal showed in 2010.  And experts criticize “that the notorious corruption and conflicts of interest at WHO have continued, even grown“ since then. The CDC as well, to take another big player, is obviously no better off.  Finally, the reasons and possible motives remain speculative, and many involved surely act in good faith; but the science is clear: The numbers generated by these RT-PCR tests do not in the least justify frightening people who have been tested “positive” and imposing lockdown measures that plunge countless people into poverty and despair or even drive them to suicide.  And a “positive” result may have serious consequences for the patients as well, because then all non-viral factors are excluded from the diagnosis and the patients are treated with highly toxic drugs and invasive intubations. Especially for elderly people and patients with pre-existing conditions such a treatment can be fatal, as we have outlined in the article “Fatal Therapie.”  Without doubt eventual excess mortality rates are caused by the therapy and by the lockdown measures, while the “COVID-19” death statistics comprise also patients who died of a variety of diseases, redefined as COVID-19 only because of a “positive” test result whose value could not be more doubtful.  NOTES:- [1] Sensitivity is defined as the proportion of patients with disease in whom the test is positive; and specificity is defined as the proportion of patients without disease in whom the test is negative.

bbf4d6a7,"Josh Mandel discloses finances, showing his wife with extensive holdings in a trust","WASHINGTON, D.C. — Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in 2012, on Friday released a copy of his delinquent personal financial disclosure report, a 47-page document showing his wife to be a millionaire with extensive investments held in a family trust.  At a minimum, Ilana Shafran Mandel's holdings are worth $1.95 million. But they could be worth as much as $7.1 million, based on a range of valuations in her husband's financial disclosure report.  Annual income from the trust was at least $860,000 last year and could have been as high as $1.8 million, thanks to dividends, capital gains, rent from real estate and distributions from gas and natural resource partnerships  Mandel's personal financial report was due to the Senate clerk on May 15, little more than a month after he signed candidacy papers on April 5. But he said the complexity and structure of his wife's finances presented questions he needed to resolve in order to file the form correctly. He said the $200 fine he'll have to pay under Senate rules is a fair price for accuracy.  Democrats derided the presumptive GOP Senate nominee for his continued lateness, suggesting he might be hiding something. Keenly aware of the criticism, the Mandel campaign hand-delivered the report to reporters around midday Friday -- yet kept Democrats who wanted to pore over it waiting by choosing to submit it to the Senate via mail. The Senate is likely to receive it early next week.  This frustrated Democratic activists who were waiting for the filing to show up at the Senate clerk's office by the 6 p.m. Friday closing time.  For nearly six months Josh Mandel broke the law and illegally refused to disclose his personal finances despite every other major Senate candidate in the country being in compliance, and now in an effort to continue his evasion tactics, he files a report which is still not yet available to the public on the weekend before the biggest election in the country this year, said Ohio Democratic Party spokesman Justin Barasky.  Based on the copy of the report released to the press, the overwhelming majority of Mandel assets are held for his wife in the JMS Trust -- short for the Joseph M. Shafran Children's Trust. Joseph Shafran is Ilana's father, and his mother -- Ilana's grandmother -- was an immigrant who with her siblings founded a lumber business that grew into Forest City Enterprises. Today, Ilana's trust-held stock in Forest City, a publicly traded company, is worth anywhere from $315,003 to $650,000.  Her other stock holdings through the trust are extensive and include Avon Products, General Electric, J. P. Morgan Chase, McDonalds, Microsoft, Sherwin-Williams and Time Warner. The trust also has an array of bond holdings including Bank of America, the Hamilton County Sewer System, and the Medina County Library. It also is invested in mutual funds, real estate, gas and natural resource partnerships, and a small stake in Wicked People Tour Inc., which Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said is related to the Broadway show Wicked.  Mandel, a Marine veteran who expects to challenge Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown next year, is not personally wealthy. He reported his income as state treasurer as $82,477, and his personal investments are worth as little as $60,000 or as much as $375,000, excluding a Lyndhurst condo he and his wife rent out, valued between $100,001 and $250,000.

Violating the  face mask rule in all provinces of Canada could result in fines up to $3,000 and even jail time.  “Starting next , people in Canada are required to wear face coverings at essential businesses, in public facilities, on transit, and while performing essential work,”.  “This is not a replacement for staying home and physical distancing, but it is an important step for safety.”  The rule officially goes into effect on May 11 at 8 a.m. So, you have until then to make or purchase your face coverings.  Loading...  The mayor’s release also noted that “noncompliance is a misdemeanor punishable by fine, imprisonment, or both.”  It is important to note that government officials state that children aged under two years old must not wear a face covering, as it is poses a choking hazard.  Children ages three through twelve are not required to wear a face covering. If they do, they must be supervised by an adult at all times.  Government states that you must wear a protective face covering when you are doing the following:      “Waiting in line to go inside a store”     “Shopping at a store”     “On public transportation or waiting for it”     “In a taxi or rideshare vehicle”     “Seeking healthcare”     “Going into facilities allowed to stay open, like government buildings”     “Working an essential job that interacts with the public”  Face coverings are not needed you are:      “At home”     “In your car alone or if you’re only with members of your household”     “Exercising outdoors, like walking, hiking, bicycling, or running”  The announcement goes on to say that staying at home is still the best protection.

5fd2bed1,Rep. Tom Graves Defends Obamacare De-Funding Effort,"ABC's Isobel Markham reports:  With the threat of a govenrment shutdown looming, Rep. Tom Graves defended his effort to defund President Obama's signature health care law on This Week Sunday.  We are united around a very simple goal, and that is keeping the government open while protecting our constituents from the harmful effects of Obamacare, Graves said. We have eight days to do that.  The House voted on Friday 230-189 along party lines to pass Graves' bill - his first as a House member - that would extend funding for government operations until mid-December, while defunding the Affordable Care Act, passed into law in 2010. The defunding bill was put forward in the House by Graves, who has taken up the fight led in the Senate by freshman Tea Party Senators Ted Cruz, R-Tex. and Mike Lee, R-Utah to pull the plug on funding for Obamacare.  Friday's continuing resolution now heads to the Democratic-controlled Senate, where it will likely be rejected. Tea Party efforts to drum up support in the Senate for defunding Obamacare has yielded lackluster results, with many leading Republicans openly acknowledging the futility of the effort.  On This Week Sunday, House budget committee ranking member Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., dismissed the efforts to defund President Obama's health care law.  There's a reason Republican senators like Senator McCain and others are saying this is absolutely insane, Van Hollen said. They're going to shut down the government if they can't deny health care to millions of Americans.  ABC News  An ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed that 52 percent are opposed to the law and only 11 percent believe Obamacare will improve their health care. Van Hollen puts this down to confusion surrounding the law, stirred up by Republicans.  I'm not surprised that there's a lot of confusion. These guys have been running around the country demagoguing, scare mongering on this issue, Van Hollen said. They're not afraid that it's going to be unsuccessful, they're afraid it's going to be successful and all of that misinformation will be shown to be a fraud.  Whenever there's a flood these days, you guys in the Republican Party say that's Obamacare, Van Hollen added.  And Van Hollen maintained that support for the health care law was made clear in the 2012 presidential election.  The biggest poll we had on this was the last election, Van Hollen said. President Obama said that she was going to implement the Affordable Care Act and Mitt Romney said he was going to defund it. And the president won on that issue and other issues.  Graves responded that since the election, the Obama administration has made changes to the law, including delaying implementation of certain portions for businesses.  Something very important has happened since the president did win the election and that he himself has amended, delayed, or repealed 19 components of his very own law, Graves said.  President Obama said Thursday he would veto any government funding bill that didn't include ACA funding. Failure to reach a resolution could result in government shutdown on October 1.

4180cb6a,"Pennsylvania rejects 372,000 mail-in ballots, leaving many voters confused: report","Pennsylvania rejects 372,000 mail-in ballots, leaving many voters confused: report  One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates  By: The Blaze, October 17, 2020:  In the immensely critical battleground state of Pennsylvania, approximately 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. The situation perplexed many voters, but officials say there is an explanation for the confusion.  ProPublica and the Philadelphia Inquirer co-published a report on Friday discovering that 372,000 mail-in ballots were rejected. Overall, one out of every five requests for mail-in ballots were rejected, according to the report.  However, 90% of those mail-in ballots, about 336,000, were denied as duplicates.  The reason for the confusion is because people may have previously and unknowingly already requested a mail-in ballot for the November election.  Many Pennsylvanians who voted during the June primaries may have checked a box to request a mail-in ballot for the November election. Many may have requested a second ballot unwittingly.  The attempt to promote mail-in voting in June amidst the coronavirus pandemic has caused administrative headaches for election officials preparing for the general election.  “We basically have to treat them all the same,” Bill Turner, acting elections director for Chester County, said. “We’re taking a tremendous amount of staff time and effort only to find out it’s a duplicate.”  “The volume of calls we have been getting has been overwhelming,” Marybeth Kuznik, elections director in Armstrong County, northeast of Pittsburgh, said. “It has been almost like a denial of service attack at times because it seemed that sometimes all I could get done was answer the phone!”  Making matters even worse, nongovernmental election groups have deluged Pennsylvania voters with mail-in ballot applications, urging voters to request mail-in ballots. Some voters assume these applications are from the state. They may think that their request for a mail-in ballot was not received by the government, so they request another mail-in ballot.  A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of State said these nongovernmental election groups have caused “confusion for voters and the likelihood that voters will not realize their application has been processed and they don’t need to submit another one.”  “Voters have also been baffled by unclear or inaccurate information on the state’s ballot-tracking website, and by a wave of mail ballot applications from political parties and get-out-the-vote groups,” the report stated. “County offices across the state have been forced to hire temporary staff and work seven days a week to cope with the confusion.”  The report found that there were hundreds of voters who submitted three or more duplicate applications. One voter was alleged to have submitted 11 duplicates.  There are concerns that the confusion over the mail-in ballots could lead to voter disenfranchisement.  Over 2.7 million Pennsylvanians have requested mail-in ballots for this election.  Also this week, nearly 30,000 mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania were sent to the wrong residences. “About 28,879 voters in Allegheny County, home to Pittsburgh, were impacted due to an error made by Midwest Direct, the company tasked with printing, collating and mailing the ballots,” as reported by Fox News.  The inaccurate mailed ballots were a result of a mapping error. Correct ballots began mailing out on Thursday.  Earlier this week, over 100 mail-in ballots were found in a Kentucky dumpster. An investigation was opened by the U.S. Postal Service Office of the Inspector General, which led to a U.S. Postal Service employee being terminated.",false
a19e0df7,CANCER IS CANDIDA/FUNGUS AND CAN BE CURED,"Here’s something your doctor, or Oncologist will never tell you. If you have cancer, then you have fungus/mold/candida. It feeds the cancer, it is cancer itself. Here’s all you need to know and how to deal with it.  Few things are scarier than hearing the words, “you have cancer.” And yet it’s something that an estimated one third, to half the population will hear at least once in their lifetime.  With such staggering rates and so much money and research poured into combating cancer, you would think we would have rounded the corner towards reducing it, or even found a cure by now. What is terrifying is that despite the millions of dollars spent every year on research, we seem to be no closer to knowing exactly what causes cancer, much less finding a cure for it.  But step away from the mainstream noise for a moment and listen to what many health professionals have understood for some time now. As more and more professors and Doctors are making the link between cancer and something else we all suffer from and that’s fungus. We would even go so far as to say cancer is a fungus. They are one and the same.  These findings are covered over  The Data is building. It’s just not been shouted about loudly enough and the voices of the many professionals that have been shouting this from the roof tops have remained more or less unheard. Whilst research papers have been ignored and down played.  For me, cancer often epitomizes the phrase, “etiology unknown.” As the root causes of cancer are never pinned down and gets ignored. Some factors remain to be seen as contributing, such as Genetics, yet in most cases the traits tend to to be more habitual than genetic. And yet, it’s actually less of a mystery than is made out, as by and large, we can see why some people get cancer and others do not.  We can narrow down the contributing factors to one or more of the following: a compromised immune system, poor diet, poor drinking water, smoking, alcoholism, substance abuse, heavy metal toxicity, asbestos poisoning, radiation, or chemicals…. Yet the main factor throughout all cases of cancer is the presence of infestations of fungus in the body.  In fact, it’s not even a new discovery and dates back to Victorian times, yet the fact remains that fungi and their mycotoxins are not as well understood by mainstream medical science as we hoped by now they would be. It’s just not a popular topic and not enough is openly discussed about this hidden killer.  It is unsurprising that any doctor would roll his eyes at the idea of a link between cancer and fungus. Yet did a little and you will discover there are many published papers throughout medical literature describing the very profound role that fungus plays in the development of cancer. So excuse the pun, but fungus has been left in the dark too long.  Let’s shed some light on fungus  Fungi produces chemical by-products as part of its natural life cycle. These chemicals are often toxic, in which case they are known as “mycotoxins”. These mycotoxins are among the most toxic, naturally occurring chemicals on earth. For example, one mycotoxin known as aflatoxin is a carcinogenic mycotoxin known to cause liver cancer. Other mycotoxins are known to be genotoxic and mutagenic and it’s well published that certain mycotoxins cause cancer.  It’s in our food  What people do not realize is that these mycotoxins are known to contaminate parts of our food supply, particularly grain and corn thus must be avoided. Knowing the huge scope those foods play in the global diet and the frequency with which most people consume those foods, the chances are that most people are regularly consuming mycotoxins. Especially the standard American diet of fast and processed foods.  Furthermore, it is published that certain fungi can actually mimic types of cancer in the body!  Certain fungal species produce a sac, or ascomycete, that on close inspection looks just like cancer cells. Just last year in a European medical journal, doctors found conclusive evidence that a breast cancer tumor was actually a sac fungus.  “The likelihood,” they stated,” that the tumor was not fungal in origin, is low.”  Breast cancer is fungus  And this is also what our team found, whilst undertaking a 2 year study in autopsy and that is that ALL breast cancers, when placed under a dark field microscope, are in fact identified as fungus, not cancer, this is where our research really did begin.  So what does this say to you? Surely this should concern us all.  As a cancer patient, you may have received a lot of information about your treatment and your journey to recovery. That Chemotherapy and radiation cause many changes in the body as they destroy the cancer cells.  And of course, one of these major changes is to your immune system. Just as you need it the most. Your now weakened immune system increases your chances of getting an infection, including, of course, any fungal infections. As we have just stated, everyone without exception with cancer has fungus, this is more than just a coincidence.  Some statistics  The numbers are staggering. Some eight million people die every year from cancer worldwide, with more than half a million in the United States alone. The global number is predicted to rise to twelve million by 2030.    Cancer is the biggest cause of death for people under 85 and in the US one in four people die from cancer – one in four. In the UK the government stated that one in every two people alive today will have cancer at some point. These figures are on the increase not decline.  And then when you look at the rise in Fungus levels, in pollution, with poor quality water, phosphate fertilizers in our food, as well as many other environmental issues. It’s no surprise the rate of cancer is set to increase, not decrease.  Sugar fuels fungus  Sugars and wheat products are a great source of fuel to any fungus. Imagine, one grain of sugar gives enough fuel for that fungus to grow quickly and establish itself.  Most people suffer from fungus in their toes and toe nails, an area of the body that can can be seen by the naked eye, but fungus can live in every living cell of your body including your skin cells. Symptoms of rash etc often are not shown until the fungus is out of control.  In August 9th, 1969 a man named Dr Richard Day, who was at the time head of the Rockerfeller controlled eugenics organization Planned Parenting, addressed a meeting of doctors in Pittsburgh about the approach of of globalisation and how this would change our lives forever. He asked the attending doctors to turn off their recording equipment, to not take notes on what he was about to say. Before he went on to detail a long list of planned changes. One doctor did take notes, however and later talked publicly about what was said.    Now, 40 years later, we can actually see how extraordinarily accurate Dr Day was, as he said: “We can cure almost every cancer RIGHT NOW. Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute, if it’s ever decided that it should be released.” Yet, letting people die of cancer would “slow down population growth.” And that “You may as well die of cancer, as something else.”    Curing cancer is bad for business  Big Pharma has no desire to cure cancer when it is making vast fortunes from treating the symptoms with devastating drugs and cell-killing, people-killing poisons like chemotherapy. And it is not even primarily about money. It’s about population overgrowth and control. He who holds the purse strings owns the power.  Doctor Simoncini and Candida  An Italian doctor Tullio Simoncini, is a brilliant and courageous man who has refused to bow to such enormous pressure. He personally has faced and continues to face an unimaginable amount of amount of stress after he realized what cancer really is and how it can be dealt with.    Simoncini’s ‘crime’ has been to discover that cancer is actually a fungus caused by Candida, a yeast-like organism that lives in the body in small amounts, even in healthy people. The immune system normally keeps it under control, but when the Candida morphs into a powerful fungus some serious health problems can follow, often in the form of cancer.      In fact Simoncini says that cancer is Candida fungal infection and that the conventional medical explanation of cancer as a cellular malfunction is plain wrong.. And we at Healing Oracle have to agree.  Candida  From the time he entered medicine he realized that something was seriously wrong with the way cancer was treated:  “I saw terrible sufferings. I was in a paediatric oncological ward – all the children died. I was suffering when I was looking at the poor, poor children dying with chemo, with radiation.”  And It was this that led him to search for new ways to understand and treat this devastating disease.  Simoncini realized that all cancers acted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white. Simoncini realized thatacted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white.  Cancer cells are white  I was fortunate enough to take a 2 year study in autopsy, where it was confirmed, without any doubt at all, that ALL patients that died with cancer had fungus in more than one part of the body. What else is white? Candida.    So what if Mainstream medicine believes cancer to be simply cell growth going wild, or “cancerous growth,” actually the immune system producing cells to defend the body from Candida attack and the sequence goes like this:  In a healthy body, Candida is kept under control by the immune system, but when that becomes undermined and weakened, so the Candida can expand and build a “colony.” This colony, eventually penetrates an organ and the immune system has to respond to the threat in another way. It builds a defensive barrier of cells around the colony and this growth becomes a lump in the body and becomes identified as “cancer”. The spread of this cancer is then triggered by the Candida fungus, escaping. Often due to a biopsy, or surgery, where the protective barrier of cells is pierced open and the candida is set free to spread elsewhere in the body.      The immune system  So if it’s the immune system that contains the Candida, so it seems as there has been a calculated war on this very system. A silent war that has gained strength over time and become more vociferous with every decade.  The immune system is weakened and attacked by food and drink additives, chemical farming, vaccinations , frequencies, pharmaceutical drugs, the stress of modern ‘life’ and so much more.  Cure Candida with Ozone  Ozone is the number one cure for fungus moulds and pathogens. Ordinary Oxygen molecules consist of only two atoms. The third atom in Ozone only stays attached until it can react with, or oxidize, another substance. If that substance is a bacteria cell or fungi, it’s doomed; the spare oxygen atoms in the ambient ozone attach to the cell walls of microorganisms and crack them open.  Ozone machines  Ozone is a naturally occurring gas created from oxygen atoms. Ozone-disinfecting systems have become popular for people wishing to clean fruit and vegetables, for keeping rooms and hot tubs clean and have been around for several years.  Oxygen is harvested from the air filtering out nitrogen and moisture to get pure oxygen, which is then passed through Corona discharge cells, which deliver a jolt of electricity that turns the O2 into O3. The process leaves oxygen and nitrogen, which is environmentally safe.  The oxygen molecule is made up of 2 oxygen atoms. These oxygen molecules are broken into atoms by the ‘corona discharge’ during lightning storms, or by UV light from the Sun. Single oxygen atoms cannot exist alone without regrouping back into di-atomic  oxygen molecules. During this recombination stage some atoms will regroup into loosely bonded tri-atomic oxygen. This new molecule is called Ozone, as seen to the right d = 1.28 A, Theta = 116.5o. Due to the loose bond in this oxygen molecule – ozone is a very strong oxidant and an ideal chemical-free purification and a disinfecting agent.  Ozone is frequently misdiagnosed and equated to low-altitude pollution. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, Ozone breaks down pollutants and should be welcomed when found in the air. The most effective way to produce Ozone commercially is through the use of pulse injected corona discharge. Disinfection by tri-atomic oxygen Ozone occurs through the rupture of the cell wall. An ozone level of 0.  4 ppm for 4 minutes has been shown to kill any bacteria, virus, mould and fungus.  Ozonated Water  Use Ozone to disinfect both water and the bottles you drink from. Drink 4oz of Ozonated water daily.  Ozone IV  Ozone can be administered via I.V to a patient 3 times a week and up-to 90ml for 2 weeks to ensure all fungus is gone.  For feet candida we suggest Hyperbaric Ozone boots.      Disclaimer  This is a very delicate procedure and should never be attempted at home. Always consult with a fully trained medical professional who fully understands all aspects of Ozone therapy and the risks involved if it is not administered, or monitored correctly.  So if cancer is fungus, is there a common, natural way to kill it and stop it spreading? Well the answer is actually in most people’s kitchen cupboard.  SODIUM BICARBONATE Yes, the main ingredient in good old Baking Soda whilst of course baking soda, contains other ingredients, it’s the Sodium Bicarbonate itself that provides the solution. In fact, it’s such a powerful weapon against fungus, unlike any synthesised drugs, the Candida simply cannot ‘adapt’ to it.  How it works  The patient is given Sodium bicarbonate orally and internally via an endoscope a long thin camera tube, used to see inside the body which allows the Sodium bicarbonate to be placed directly on the cancer fungus itself. Preventing any growth and killing the candida infestation.  Dr Simocini’s many successes have been down played and no clinical trials conducted. It’s a relatively simple and cheap solution and yet all this time millions of people are dying from cancers that could have been treated easily and effectively.  Understanding Salvestrols  In April 2017, two British scientists and researchers, Professor Gerry Potter of the Cancer Drug Discovery Group and Professor Dan Burke published a newsletter. Their combined findings reveal the following:  Cancer cells have a unique ‘biomarker’ that normal cells do not, an enzyme called CYP1B1 pronounced sip-one-bee-one. Enzymes are proteins that ‘catalyze’ increase the rate of chemical reactions.    Organic Fruit and veg  The CYP1B1 alters the chemical structure of something called Salvestrols that are found naturally in many fruit and vegetables. This chemical change turns the salvestrols into an agent that kills cancer cells, but does not harm healthy cells.  The synchronicity is perfect. The CYP1B1 enzyme appears only in cancer cells and it reacts with salvestrols in fruit and vegetables to create a chemical substance that kills only cancer cells.  Salvestrols is the natural defence system found in fruit and vegetables and especially those that are subject to fungus damage. And alarmingly, the chemical fungicide sprays used in modern farming, only artificially kills fungus, which means the plants and crops do not have to trigger their own defence mechanism salvestrols. And so this is why only organic and non GMO foods contain the Salevestrols your body needs to fight cancer.  In fact, the most widely-used fungicides are such powerful blockers of CYP1B1 that if you eat enough chemically-produced food it wouldn’t matter how many salvestrols you then consumed, they are no longer effective as the cancer-destroying agent they are designed to be.  More on the effects of fungus  The biggest cause of fungus is on our feet. We bathe or shower and forget about our feet, that serve us so well. It is important to lift each foot to wash and thoroughly dry them. Wearing open toe shoes as much as possible to allow your feet to breath.  Sneakers should only be worn for training, not for everyday purpose. Sprinkling bicarbonate of soda on your feel after drying is very helpful. Dead skin builds up on the feet, becoming bacteria and fungus.  Removing all dead skin from feet is extremely important.Expose feet as much as possible. Make friends with your feet, become well antiquated and give them some love.  We suggest Ozonation of feet in bad cases for a speedy recovery.  Fungus infections can vary significantly Some fungal infections are mild skin rashes, but others can be deadly, like fungal pneumonia. Because of this, it’s important to eradicate any fungus as soon as possible to try to avoid serious infection.  Fungal infections can look like bacterial or viral nfections. Which is a very common mistake and the resulting antibiotics are ineffective and can lead to gut flora issues later down the line.  The type of cancer you have can affect your risk. If you have a blood cancer like leukemia or myeloma, you may be at an even greater risk of further fungal infection than people with other types of cancer.  Your risk of infection can change based on the strength of your chemotherapy. Aggressive chemotherapy completely depletes your immune system and can put you at risk of getting a fungal infection that will fuel the cancer.  Your hospital stay matters. The longer you are in hospital the greater the risk of fungal infection due the hospitals heating system running at temperatures perfect for breading fungus, bacteria and infection.  Where you live geography matters. Some disease-causing fungi are more common in certain parts of the world. If you live in, or visit these areas and have cancer you may be more likely to get these infections than the general population. Humidity also promote fungus and bacteria.  Preventing fungal infections in cancer patients. Fungi are difficult but not impossible to avoid because they are a natural part of the environment. It lives outdoors, in soil, on plants, trees and other vegetation. They are also on many indoor surfaces and on your skin. However, there may be some ways for you to lower the chances of getting an infection, including a serious fungal infection.  Know if your white blood cell count is low. Having a very low white blood cell count can put you at greater risk of infection and fungus.  Protect yourself from the environment. As you start to recover from the effects of As you start to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and start doing your normal activities again, there are some ways to lower the chances of getting a serious fungal infection by trying to avoid disease-causing fungi in the environment:  Try to avoid areas with a lot of dust like construction, or excavation sites.  Stay inside during dust storms.  Stay away from areas with bird and bat droppings. This includes places like chicken coops and caves.  Wear gloves when handling materials such as soil, moss, or manure.  Wear long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when doing outdoor activities such as gardening, yard work, or visiting wooded areas and completely wash and dry your feet after walks.  Using 1 cup of apple cider vinegar or half a cup of bicarbonate of soda in a bath tub, or bucket for feet will stop fungus growing.  dehumidifiers in the home will take help take out moisture in the room.  Vacuum AC units every 2 weeks and lightly spray air conditioner filters with apple cider vinegar solution, 1 cup to 1 ltr of water  Don’t forget to do the same with your vehicle.    Cancer-Fungus and the Connection  Another link between fungi and cancer is their relationship with sugar and Gluten. Healthy cells in our bodies use glucose and oxygen to produce ATP adenosine triphosphate, which is the main source of energy for cell functions. Cancer cells, on the other hand, use fermentation to produce ATP. Fermentation does not use oxygen and is, in general, a very inefficient way to produce energy. Cancer cells must consume large amounts of sugar in order to survive and grow.  Cancer cells love fungus and fungus thrives on sugar and gluten. What is the first thing you do when candida gets out of control? That’s right − lay off the sugar and simple carbs like bread and pasta.  In addition, growing fungi produce chemicals called mycotoxins, which have played some part in the development of cancer in humans according to experimental data. The connection between mycotoxins and cancer lies in its ability to effect the protein production within cells. For example, it can effect protein 53, a protein that, when healthy, can activate other proteins that repair DNA.  According to Dr. Lynn Jennings, family practitioner and medical writer: “A defective p53 protein could allow abnormal cells to proliferate, resulting in cancer. As many as 50% of all human tumors contain p53 mutations.”  If Cancer is a Fungus, Lets Treat it Like a Fungus  Dr. A.V. Constantini, retired head of the World Health Organization’s center for mycotoxins in food, believes that an anti-fungal cancer medication may be just over the horizon. Over the last decades, there has been some anecdotal evidence to support this prediction.  Dr. Simoncini, on the other hand is more doubtful because of the basic nature of fungi itself. “They are social elements,” he says. “They network and they will adapt.”  Dr. Simoncini’s solution to heal cancer naturally is simple. It adheres to the basic principles of natural cancer therapies and to my 7 Essentials ™ System, an evidence-based approach to support and heal the body naturally: change the internal environment in the body from one of acidity which cancer cells love to alkalinity.  Dr. Simoncini recommends the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy. Because the most effective way to shrink tumors is through direct contact with the sodium bicarbonate, in most cases a catheter is used to go through the arteries to the organs within the body.  For some cancers, including breast cancer, a simple local infiltration or injection can be used instead. Dr. Simoncini himself claims that this method carries a 99% success rate for healing breast cancer without surgery.  One can also enjoy an alkaline Sodium bicarbinate drink every day. In a glass of purified water, add the juice of ½ lemon and 1 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate. Stir and enjoy. Because this is such an alkaline drink, always consume it 30 minutes before and at least two hours after a meal as proper digestion requires an acidic pH in the stomach.  In order to prevent breast cancer naturally, be aware of the signs and follow a healthy anti-cancer regime that includes the anti-fungus diet, herbal supplementation, detoxing, emotional healing, biological dentistry, energy balancing and early detection. Maintaining the proper alkaline balance in your body is key to keeping fungal growth − and breast cancer − at bay.  There has yet to be discovered any antibiotic that is truly effective in the virus arena. There are indications that DNA viruses such as Herpes are  implicated in human cancers, since they organize the genetic material of the host cell to produce new viruses. Ozone will inactivate viruses on contact, even at very low residual concentrations. In case of polio, only 0.012 ppm removes all viral cells in less than 10 seconds.  Mold, fungus and mildew are easily controlled by Ozone presenting air and in water. Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts are susceptible to Ozone but not affected by normal levels of Chlorine. The Effects of Ozone on Pathogens The antipathogenic effects of ozone have been substantiated for several decades.  Its killing action upon bacteria, viruses, fungi, and in many species of protozoa, serve as the basis for its increasing use in disinfecting municipal water supplies in cities worldwide.  Bacteria are microscopically small single-cell creatures having a primitive structure. They take up foodstuffs and release metabolic products, and multiply by division. The bacteria body is sealed by a relatively solid cell membrane. Their vital processes are controlled by a complex enzymatic system.  Ozone interferes with the metabolism of bacterium cells, most likely through inhibiting and blocking the operation of the enzymatic control system. A sufficient amount of ozone breaks through the cell membrane, and this leads to the destruction of the bacteria. Viruses are small, independent particles, built of crystals and macromolecules. Unlike bacteria, they multiply only within the host cell. Ozone destroys viruses by diffusing through the protein coat into the nucleic acid core, resulting in damage of the viral RNA.  At higher concentrations, ozone destroys the capsid or exterior protein shell by oxidation. Indicator bacteria in effluents, namely coliformas and  pathogens such as Salmonella, show marked sensitivity to ozone inactivation. Other bacterial organisms susceptible to ozone’s disinfecting properties include:  Streptococci, Shigella, legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aerunginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacteria, Kelbsiella, pneumonia, and Escherichia coli. Ozone destroys both aerobic and importantly, anaerobic bacteria which are mostly responsible for the devastating sequel of complicated infections, as exemplified by decubitus ulcers and gangrene. The mechanisms of ozone bacterial destruction need to be further elucidated.  It is known that the cell enveloped of bacteria are made of polysaccharides and proteins and that in Gram negative organisms, fatty acid alkyl chains and helical lipoproteins are present. In acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, on third to one half of the capsule is formed of complex lipids esterified mycolic acid, in addition to normal fatty acids, and glycolipids sulfolipids, lipopolysaccharides, mycosides, trehalose mycolates. The high lipid content of the cell walls of these ubiquitous bacteria may explain their sensitivity, and eventual demise, subsequent to ozone exposure. Ozone may also penetrate the cellular envelope, directly affecting cytoplasmic integrity, disrupting any one of numerous levels of its metabolic complexities.  Numerous families of viruses including poliovirus I and 2, human rotavruses, Norwalk virus, Parvoviruses, and Hepatitis A, B and non-A non-B?, among many others, are susceptible to the virucidal actions of ozone. Most research efforts on ozone’s virucidal effects have centered upon ozone’s propensity to break apart lipid molecules at sites of multiple bond configuration. Indeed, once the lipid envelope of the virus is fragmented, its DNA or RNA core cannot survive.  Non-enveloped viruses Adenoviridae, Picornaviridae, namely poliovirus, Coxsachie, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, Hepatitis A and E, and Reoviridae Rotavirus, have also begun to be studied. Viruses that do not have an envelope are called “naked viruses.” They are constituted of a nucleic acid core made of DNA or RNA and a nucleic acid coat, or capsid, made of protein. Ozone, however, aside from its well-recognized action upon unsaturated lipids, can also interact with certain proteins and their constituents, namely amino acids. Indeed, when ozone comes in contact with capsid proteins, protein hydroxides and protein hydroxides and protein hydroperoxides are formed. Viruses have no protections against oxidative stress. Normal mammalian cells, on the other hand possess complex systems of enzymes i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, which tend to ward off the nefarious effects of free radical species and oxidative challenge. It may thus be possible to treat infected tissues with ozone, respecting the homeostasis derived from their natural defences, while neutralizing offending and attacking pathogen devoid of similar defences.  The enveloped viruses are usually more sensitive to physico-chemical challenges than are naked virions. Although ozone’s effects upon unsaturated lipids is one of its best documented iochemical action, ozone is known to interact with proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. This becomes especially relevant when ozone inactivation of non-enveloped virions is considered.  Fungi families inhibited and destroyed by exposure to ozone include Candida, Aspergilus, Histoplasma, Actinomycoses, and Cryptococcus. The walls of fungi are multilayered and re composed of approximately 80% carbohydrates and 10% of proteins and glycoproteins. The presence of many disulfide bonds had been noted, making this a possible site for oxidative inactivation by ozone. In all likelihood, however, ozone has the capacity to diffuse through the fungal wall into the organismic cytoplasm, thus disrupting cellular organelles. Protozoan organisms disrupted by ozone include Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and free-living amoebas, namely Acanthamoeba, Hartmonella, and Negleria. The anit-protozoal action has yet to be elucidated.

Some of the most common causes of this type of infection are dirt, pollution, accumulated sweat as a result of wearing very tight socks and shoes for a longer period of time and walking in dirty water during rainy season. Not washing and ignoring them can lead to harmful consequences.  Here are 7 home remedies you can try to treat toenail fungus.  Tea tree oil contains antifungal and antiseptic abilities, which is very effective in fighting against toenail fungus. Apply few drop of the tea tree oil directly onto the affected nail with a cotton swab. Repeat this twice daily.  Both apple cider vinegar and white vinegar are considered as powerful home remedies to get rid of fungal infections because of its acidic properties.  Soak the infected nail in one part vinegar and two parts warm water for up to 20 minutes everyday. After that, rinse off with water.  Like tea tree oil, garlic, which is a staple in most kitchens, too has antifungal and antimicrobial properties. You can treat toenail fungus by placing crushed garlic cloves on the affected area for half an hour.  Then after it becomes dry, rinse off with water.  Real Organic Honey helps kill fungus and bacteria by flushing out toxins from the body as it contains hydrogen peroxide. Take a tablespoon of honey and apply it on the toenail. Keep for half an hour and then wash off with water. Repeat this twice on a daily basis.  You can use baking soda not only to treat nail fungus, but also to eliminate foot odour. You need to prepare a mixture for this:  Take a bowl and pour 4 cups of hot water, half cup of baking soda, one-fourth cup of hydrogen peroxide and half cup of Epsom salt.  Mix these ingredients properly and add one-fourth cup of white vinegar. Soak the infected nail",false
10caf08a,Banned By Facebook – DO NOT READ! Bad Math Driving Wisconsin’s Exploding Positive Test Rate,"Why does it look like the state is testing at only a quarter of its lab capacity?  Why does it look like Wisconsin’s positive test rate has exploded?  Is DHS making a simple math error?  Is DHS throwing away hundreds of thousands of negative test results to make its math work?  Is the Evers Administration making key decisions using bad math?  September 23, 2020  A fundamental flaw in how the Evers’ Administration calculates Wisconsin’s daily COVID-19 positive test rate has excluded hundreds of thousands of test results and led to a wildly distorted picture of the state’s progress in confronting the virus.  The positive test rate is important, because it is one of six gating criteria the Evers’ Administration uses to make public health policy decisions that affect the entire state. Specifically, the requirement is for the “Downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests within a 14-day period.”  Throughout August and September, Wisconsin’s positive test rate steadily increased from a weekly average of 6.2% to 19% as of Sep. 21st.  The number of new people with a positive test result each day is less important, but gets more attention. That’s not surprising because the Department of Health Services DHS posts the number of new positive cases each day prominently at the top of its summary dashboard, while one must hunt for the actual test rate on the page.  As the test rate has steadily ticked up over the past two months, Wisconsin has had five record setting days for the number of new positive cases. Most of the increase has occurred among the 18-24 age group and is tied to college campuses. That’s where public officials are now focusing their efforts, but not every reporter has forgotten the importance of the rate.  “What’s behind the rise in percent positive rates?” Wispolitics’ Stephanie Hoff bluntly asked Dr. Ryan Westergaard, Wisconsin’s Chief Medical Officer on Sep. 15th.  This systematic error means DHS is tossing hundreds of thousands of negative test results when calculating the positive test rate. The real rate could be half of what DHS claims.  “Well, it’s a ratio so it has two components: the numerator – the top number of course is the number of positive cases,” he replied. “The bottom number of the ratio is the denominator. That’s the number of people that have been tested overall.”  This was an incredible admission. If the goal is to calculate the daily positive test rate, then DHS is using the wrong numerator and denominator. What they’re actually calculating is the daily percentage of new COVID-19 cases among those who have never been tested before – a fairly meaningless statistic. It is not the positive test rate.  On that same day, Sep. 15th, DHS recorded the rate as 11%. That was calculated by comparing 1,352 new cases to 12,266 new people tested. However, there were almost 20,000 tests collected that day. If DHS compared that day’s number of positive tests to the total number of test results, the rate would have been much lower – possibly as low as 6.7%. They’ve been making this same mistake since the spring.  This systematic error means DHS is tossing hundreds of thousands of negative test results when calculating the positive test rate. The real rate could be half of what DHS claims.  Origin of the Error  When it first started collecting COVID-19 data, DHS recognized that people were getting tested multiple times. Some people tested positive for the virus one week, and then still had it when they were retested a week later. If the department wasn’t careful, it might be accidentally counting single cases of COVID-19 over and over, and include them in the official tally. That would inflate Wisconsin’s total COVID-19 cases – a mistake that surely would be caught.  The department decided on a data collection method that would pick and choose which test results to use. Dr. Westergaard explained the reasoning during a June 11th press conference.  “Our data reports individuals tested. So, if an individual is tested more than once because they were being followed to see if they cleared the infection or if they were tested a couple times weeks apart, they would be considered a single case and not multiple cases in our data,” Westergaard explained.  DHS acknowledges this method on its data summary dashboard. The fine print plainly states “Multiple tests per person are not included in these summary statistics.”  And so, every day DHS compares the number of new COVID-19 cases to the number of people who were tested for the first time to determine the positive test rate. Under this method, it throws away the results for everyone that has ever been tested before. That means every day thousands of negative test results are not included in the rate calculation.  DHS has discarded hundreds of thousands of results since it began reporting COVID-19 data. Most people who are tested for COVID-19 receive negative test results.  As the pool of people who have never been tested before continues to shrink, the number of negative results getting tossed will naturally increase. Subsequently the positive test rate will continue to artificially rise.  Scope of the Error  Each day’s positive test rate needs to be calculated using all the test results from that day. Only DHS can correct this error, because only it has access to all the test results.  Although DHS’ website is filled with all kinds of COVID-19 related data – it does not post the total number of test results it receives each day. However, it does report the number of total tests collected by health care professionals across the state each day. That figure cannot be used to calculate the daily rate, because there is a lag from the time a test is collected and when the results come back.  Each day’s positive test rate needs to be calculated using all the test results from that day.  However, we can still get a good look at the problem using weekly averages.  Altogether, there have been approximately 2.1 million tests, 1.4 million people tested, and 101,321 positive cases as of Sep. 20th. Using DHS’ flawed methodology, officials have tossed around 600,000 test results in calculating the daily positive test rate. That results in an overall rate of 7%, while the real rate could be as low as 4.8%.  That might not seem like a big difference overall. However, public officials aren’t looking at the big picture. They’re looking at this rate on a day-to-day basis, and only 14 days back. The inherent flaws in DHS’ formula means the difference between the official rate and the real rate consistently grows.  When DHS first began collecting COVID-19 data, no one had been tested before, and few results were discarded. At that time, the rate calculated by DHS would have been fairly accurate.  However, as time goes on, more and more people are re-tested. That means more and more results are thrown out. Inevitably the rate will become more and more inaccurate unless DHS corrects its calculations.  Yesterday, 12,537 people in Wisconsin, who had never been tested before, got their #COVID19 test results. Those were the only results @DHSWI used to calculate the daily positive test rate. It’s been using this method from the beginning. https://t.co/8qx2wIe0lh #WIright pic.twitter.com/tYNOpDDVuW — MacIver Institute @MacIverWisc September 23, 2020  Testing Capacity  The cracks in DHS’ methodology are beginning to show.  The Evers Administration is increasingly confronted with questions it cannot answer even when the answers are right on DHS’ website.  For example, some reporters have noticed that the state’s lab capacity is much higher than – what they believe to be – the number of new test results each day.  In August, lab capacity was around 26,000 tests a day, and an average of 15,600 test were administered each day. That meant labs were running at about 60% capacity. In September, lab capacity increased to 38,000 tests a day, and an average of 20,685 tests were administered each day. That meant labs were running at about 54% capacity. However, the way DHS presents its data could lead some to believe there are only around 10,000 tests being administered each day – or about 26 – 38%.  “Why do we continue to be at a quarter the rate of testing capacity? Is it a shortage of supplies or people just not getting tested?” a reporter asked Palm at a press conference on Sep. 16th.  “This is certainly a complicated question and therefor a complicated answer and some of it is just speculation,” Palm replied.  Clearly, the reporter was confused or did not realize that the number of new people being tested is different from the number of tests being collected. Palm had the opportunity to correct this confusion, but she either didn’t listen to the question or doesn’t understand the issue herself.  Even Dr. Westergaard, who has repeatedly demonstrated his understanding of what data is available and how the rate is calculated, has yet to point out the complete truth of these fundamental issues.  That reporter is not the first one to ask why test numbers always appear to be well below the state’s capacity. Once reporters begin to understand the difference between individuals tested and the number of tests actually collected, they will be able to identify the bad math DHS uses to calculate Wisconsin’s rate. They will then be able to ask why the state is making public policy decisions based on this bad math.  Whether or not the Evers Administration or the Capitol press corps figure this out on their own eventually won’t matter. As the number of new individuals getting tested continues to drop, the day will come when there are more positive test results than new individuals being tested. Once the daily positive test rate rises above 100%, no one will be able to ignore the math any longer.  Solving the Problem  DHS was right to take steps to ensure its total case count was accurate, but the positive test rate is just as important.  DHS should also calculate the positive test rate every day using all the results from that day. Since no one is tested twice in the same day, this will ensure that each day’s rate is accurate. That will ensure the gating requirement is reflecting the correct data.  This is something DHS could start doing today. It needs to start doing this today, because it’s current method is producing inaccurate results – which the Evers Administration continues to use in its gating criteria to make pivotal public policy decisions that affect everyone in Wisconsin.  MacIver reached out to Dr. Westergaard on Tuesday morning, but has yet to receive a response.",false
e7397a29,A top German doctor recommends whiskey to protect against COVID-19 he’s joking…but still,"Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a series about how branches of the military hate on each other. We’ll feature all branches of the U.S. military, written by veterans of that branch being brutally honest with themselves and their services.  The branches of the U.S. military are like a very large family. They deal with one another because they have to, not because they always get along.  The differences don’t stop at uniforms. Each branch has its own goals, mission, and its own internal culture. At the upper levels of the services, they compete for funds and favor from civilians in DoD. In the lower ranks, they compete for fun and favor from civilians in bars and strip clubs especially in North Carolina. The branches are like siblings, competing for the intangible title of who’s “the best” from no one in particular.  “The Soviets are our adversary. Our enemy is the Navy.” —Gen. Curtis LeMay, U.S. Air Force  Of course, when it comes to joint operations downrange, a lot of that goes out the window. But when the op-tempo isn’t as hectic and frustration has time to build, the awesome Army platoon who saved your ass last month become a bunch of damn stupid grunts who steal everything you don’t lock down and leave their Gatorade piss bottles everywhere. Parsing out the best and worst of our services isn’t hard if we’re honest with ourselves.  Here’s how the other branches hate on the Navy, how they should actually be hating on the Navy, how the Navy hates on the Navy, and why to really love the Navy.  The easiest ways to make fun of the Navy  Sailor harassment has its roots in the age-old reality that since man first decided to put military power to sea in ships, those aboard those ships were forced to spend weeks and months underway before being afforded a few days of downtime in a foreign port. As a result of this ratio, sailors may have had a tendency for exuberance while on liberty over the years. And that exuberance may have caused a scuffle or two that caught the attention of bar owners and other locals who may have developed impressions that were less than positive.  Over time these locals spread rumors that these sailors couldn’t hold their liquor and tended to burn through what little cash they had in a short time. Word of these phenomena returned stateside, which gave birth to the saying, “spending money like a sailor on liberty.”  Because sailors spend time on the water, service members from other military branches wanted to give them a nickname that was both sufficiently pejorative and germane. Naturally marine life came to mind. “Sharks” was too cool and tough and “guppies” was too cute, so they settled on “squids.” So if you want to make fun of a sailor call him or her a “squid.” They really hate that because squids are spineless and ugly and otherwise devoid of personality. They can swim fast, but nobody really cares about that.  Because SEALs. In the wake of the Bin Laden raid, SEALs have managed to morph from silent professionals to the warfare specialty that is quick to tell all to land book and movie deals.  Because Top Gun. No other military movie in history has done more to give the public the wrong idea about what it means to serve. And it’s got a lot of homoerotic imagery, which leads to . . .  . . . The quickest way to strike a squid’s nerve is to make “gay” jokes. Yes, you know the kind, “100 sailors go out, 50 couples come back,” or “it ain’t gay if it’s under way,” and many, many more. It also doesn’t help that sailors are a popular gay fantasy.  Henri Belolo created the Village People around macho male stereotypes that gays fantasize about. The cowboy, cop, construction worker, leather-clad biker, Indian, and the sailor. The band became popular, moved into the mainstream and took the sailor in the cute Crackerjack uniform along with it. Yes, we said “cute.” Admit it, the sailor dress uniform has more in common with the Japanese school girl uniform than with the other service branches.  Not that there’s anything wrong with being gay, of course. This is, after all, the post-DADT world.  Because nuclear power. While the introduction of this science gave Navy ships the ability to sail a long, long time without refueling, the existence of it also created a zero-tolerance culture that has raised the bar of fun suppression to heights that can never be lowered. And this ability to sweat the load has crossed over into other warfare specialties and other branches of the military. Thanks, Nukes . . .  Why to actually hate the Navy  Every service tries to imitate the Marine Corps when it comes to celebrating its birthday, and the Navy’s history makes this in many ways the biggest joke which is a polite way to say “the biggest lie”. While the Navy uses October 13, 1775 as the birth date, they leave out the fact that the first version of the U.S. Navy was dismantled completely after the Revolutionary War because the ragtag bunch of vessels they managed to assemble on the fly did little to protect ports or disrupt the British in any way.  John Paul Jones kicks some British butt. Congress appreciated it so much they dismantled the Navy after the war.  And this anti-Navy sentiment in and around DC lasted a while after that. Thomas Jefferson hated the idea of a standing Navy and few in Congress thought any differently about it. It wasn’t until early Navy badass Stephen Decatur decided to take a couple of ships to Tripoli to raise some Yankee hell against the Barbary Pirates. His successes made lawmakers take notice and actually warm to the idea of a standing Navy, and one with an over-the-horizon outlook.  Decatur Boarding a Tripolitan Gunboat. Painting by Dennis M. Carter  So the real birth date of the Navy would be somewhere around 1810 when Decatur took the USS United States up and down the east coast to show the American public what they had in terms of seagoing capability.  Hate SAPR training and the CYA leadership atmosphere you’re currently serving under? Blame the Navy.  All the mechanisms that surround using the military as a social experiment and other morale-sapping things that get labeled as “politically correct” started with the Tailhook Scandal in the early ’90s. Of course, sexual battery, never mind harassment, is a bad thing that should never be tolerated, but Navy leadership over the years has done little to stop agenda-based over-corrections that have marginalized the culture in undesirable ways in the eyes of those who intimate they know about warfighting and such.  So, regardless of your branch, if you feel like you’re serving in a nanny state, blame the Navy.  Because Jimmy Carter. He’s a Naval Academy grad and a submariner, but he never really acted like it when he was Commander-in-chief. His “man is inherently good” naivete made for some very bad foreign policy, most notably in how he de-fanged the CIA and emboldened the Iranian government to take Americans hostage for 444 days. And the Desert One rescue attempt was a disaster. Basically his time in the White House made the country very happy to see Ronald Reagan.  And because the Navy is the absolute worst when it comes to changing uniforms. Remember aviation greens? How about service dress khaki? No? Well, here’s one for you: aquaflage. What are you hiding in, the water? And if a sailor is in the water don’t you want to be able to see him or her? We rest our case.  Because they wrecked most of what was cool about the band Godsmack and made them corporate sellouts.  Because sailors don’t have to eat MREs when they deploy. Ships are built with mess decks and Navy cooks and supply officers generally take pride in serving the crew good food.  Why to love the Navy  Because Navy SEALs. They popped OBL and the Somali pirates and many more high value bad actors since 9-11. Their warfighting skills are second to none.  Because Hollywood remains enamoured by Navy life, it keeps teeing up Navy-themed shows like “The Last Ship,” and as a result, the general public has a favorable opinion of the military.  Because strike warfare. As has been the case throughout history U.S. Navy carriers and surface combatants were the first on the scene after 9-11, and because of that we were able to take it to the enemy a mere three weeks after the homeland was attacked.  Because the U.S. Navy really is, as the commercials state, “a global force for good.” From Hurricane Katrina to the Haitian earthquake to the tsunami in Thailand, when a country needs humanitarian assistance, the Navy has always been first on the scene.

U.S. Navy photo by Capt. Paul Duncan  Because the Navy continues to fight “the war between the wars.” The Navy goes to potentially hostile places like the littorals of Yemen and Chinese-claimed islands to prove to those nations that we’re willing to protect the sea lanes to keep goods moving safely to and from our shores.  And the Navy also gets to show Jessica Simpson how to shoot a machine gun!  H/t: SB and OV",false
52091c5f,Trump Orders Guantanamo Bay To Prepare For 'High Level' Prisoners,"President Trump has ordered Guantanamo Bay to prepare for incoming ‘high level’ prisoners, including American politicians, within the next few months.  According to a Military of Defense report, Trump is preparing to transfer an unknown number of ‘VIP’ American detainees to the notorious prison in preparation for their trials before a US Military Tribunal.  Reports suggest that people connected to the Uranium One scandal are being placed in custody in preparation for the trials.  Hundreds of US Army Military Police have also been deployed to Cuba to help oversee the process.  According to the DoD report, while conducting routine training missions in Cuba, intercepted an unusually large number of encrypted communications emanating between the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base Cuba and Luke Air Force Base Arizona—immediately after which they made a request to SVR counterintelligence analysts for an explanation of—with the SVR, in turn, then reporting to SCT that these communications were being conducted between the Guantanamo Military Commission that holds US Military Tribunals and US Attorney Generals Jeff Sessions.  On 11 April 2017, also, this report says, the SVR reported to SCT that Attorney General Sessions was at Luke Air Force Base to “hold/conduct” meetings with various commanders of the Arizona Army National Guard AZ ARNG—with the longest of them being with the commanders of the 850th Military Police Battalion—that numbers nearly 800 highly trained and specialized US Army Military Police forces.  Since its beginning on 11 April 2017, this report continues, SCT intercepts of communications between Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Luke Air Force Base continued on an unprecedented basis—with the largest amount of such communications being reported on 7 July 2017—and was the date Attorney General Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein made an unannounced visit to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base—and whose meetings there on that date included the commanders of the 850th Military Police Battalion who had been flown there the day prior.  The specific type of communication intercepts noted by SCT occurring between Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Luke Air Force Base, this report details, were encrypted video satellite broadcasts transmitted at the North American standard rate of 59.94 frames per second—and whose near predictable times of transmission suggested to SVR analysts that these video broadcasts were being used for classroom instruction.  On 21 December 2017, this report further notes, SCT reported that nearly all of these communications between Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Luke Air Force Base had ceased—with the SVR reporting that this cessation occurred when US Defense Secretary James “Mad Dog” Mattis made an unprecedented-unannounced visit to Guantanamo—the first visit there by a US Defence Secretary in nearly 16 years—and that in doing, Secretary Mattis shockingly broke with the longstanding tradition of persons holding his high office visiting American troops on the front lines—but that he deemed his sudden visit to Guantanamo was vitally more important than.  And as to how “vitally important” Secretary Mattis deemed his unprecedented visit to Guantanamo, this report says, became known yesterday, 29 December 2017, when President Trump suddenly ordered the entire 850th Military Police Battalion to immediately deploy from Luke Air Force Base to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.  With the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp holding only 41 detainees, but able to hold nearly 800, this report notes, President Trump’s suddenly ordering there such a large number of US Military Police forces requires a further explanation as to why—and which the SVR says can be found in the equally sudden activity of the secretive IBC Airways—and whom, upon President Trump’s ordering the 850th Military Police Battalion to immediately deploy to Guantanamo, announced, on 29 December 2017, that it is increasing its flights to Naval Station Guantanamo Bay to three times a week—thus highly suggesting its anticipation of a flood of visitors there—most likely to include American attorneys defending their soon to be imprisoned traitorous clients.  To the likelihood of President Trump actually imprisoning his “Deep State” enemies, who are currently engaged in a coup against him, General Staff Deputy Defense Minister Tatiana Shevtsova in this report lays out the trail that Trump’s been following since he first took office—and whose clues can be found in his “extreme vetting” immigration plan—the long history of which his enemies have ignored to their peril.  Though not known to the American people, this report explains, “Deep State” aligned leftist US Federal Judges have been battling Trump over his “extreme vetting” plans since the very week he took office—with their reason being because Trump has asserted his power to act based upon “one of the most controversial and least understood laws in the history of the United States”—that’s known as McCarran Act or Internal Security Act of 1950 that allows for the detention of dangerous, disloyal, or subversive persons in times of war or “internal security emergency”.  As founding FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover had warned the US Congress in the late 1940’s that “it only took twenty-three Commies to overthrow Russia”, this report continues, the Internal Security Act of 1950 was enacted into law in order to protect the American president and government from an internal coup like the one Trump is now facing—and that President Trump, on 21 December 2017—the exact same day Secretary Mattis made his sudden visit to Guantanamo—enacted the first phase of by his signing an Executive Order declaring that America, indeed, was now in a state of “National Emergency”—with his exactly naming, too, the Hillary Clinton linked persons seeking to overthrow the US government.  Mostly unknown to the American people when President Trump arrests and detains for US Military Tribunal trials in Guantanamo these “Deep State” coup plotters, this report further notes, is that it was actually President Barack Obama who, in 2012, signed this presidential power into law with the feared National Defense Authorization Act—and that authorizes the indefinite military detention, without charge or trial, of any person labeled a “belligerent”—including an American citizen.  Equally unknown to the vast majority of the American people, too, this report concludes, is that the current “Deep State” coup plot against President Trump is not the first one their nation has faced either—but is, in fact, its second—with the first being in 1933 when the “Deep State” launched the “Business Plot Coup” against President Franklin Roosevelt in order so they could join the United States with the globalist power Nazi Germany—with this coup plot being led by the Nazi-aligned Bush Family—but with this coup being destroyed by US Marine General Smedley Butler—whose mighty shoes US Marine General James “Mad Dog” Mattis now stands in so that he, too, might save his nation.",false
d0b11b17,163 Paid Protesters Just Filed A Lawsuit Against George Soros For Not Paying Their Bail,"163 paid protesters have filed a lawsuit against none other than George Soros for screwing them out of bail money. According to the ad Soros placed on Craigslist, protesters would be fully compensated for all of their time and expenses. They found out that the money dried up the moment they got arrested.  A spokesman for the Soros company, Paid Liberal Trolls of America, says the men and women who signed up were told up-front that they should obey the law and not go to jail:  “They were paid for 6 hours at $30 per hour, plus a meal stipend of $40 per day. Add to that a very generous 70 cents per mile for travel and a big cookie, and these people were given neary $1K to be there. All they had to do was go home before curfew. They chose to stay, so they can pay their own bail.”  Soros has a bad habit of not paying bail for his protesters, citing case after case of people not showing up for court. “If they don’t show up. we don’t get those funds back, and we can’t write them off as a business expense,” said Attorney Joe Barron, “They should know better than to expect someone as kind as George Soros to just toss an extra $500 per person out the window.”  Some protesters might be satisfied with that answer, but most are not. According to their leader, Art Tubolls, the 163 people filing the suit will show at the Soros mansion in Deluth if they have to:  “We’re not afraid to protest for real. Charlie Kirk and Turning Point said they’ll fund that endeavor, even if it means he has to bail us out. That guy’s giant head is filled with kindness.”  Turning Point says they’re always happy to assist people looking to pick themselves up by the bootstraps and earn an honest day’s pay.

71986c29,Tapping private resources for public university good: Guest opinion,"By Jim Francesconi  As we pass the governance torch from the State Board of Higher Education to independent boards at the University of Oregon, Portland State University and Oregon State University, we will be navigating a future of heightened risks and rewards.  The rewards lie in the private sector reinforcements that are coming to the aid of our three major research universities. The caliber of some board nominees are similar to those found at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and other prestigious private universities. Major Oregon CEOs and entrepreneurs have volunteered to use their power, influence and resources to benefit Oregon's public universities.  Oregon is a small state with limited public resources, great needs and high aspirations. Although our universities have a few of the nation's best programs, we are not living up to our potential. That is what happens when state funding for  becomes mired near the bottom of all states for more than 20 years. Now there is the promise to leverage private resources for this vital public purpose.  But there are risks as well. We need high-quality engineering and other research programs, but we cannot afford them at every campus. Portland needs to be served, with PSU in charge, but so does every part of our state. Our small schools should be strengthened, not sacrificed. Sports are important, but not the highest priority. As vital as universities are, they are means to public ends, not ends in and of themselves.  Oregon needs a vibrant, innovative economy. Our universities can create more research collaboratives such as ONAMI Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute and the Portland Life Sciences center, which attract world-class talent and create jobs. Next up ... the Light Metals Institute sponsored by Oregon and Washington universities and the Manufacturing 21 business coalition.  Oregon's per capita income is almost 10 percent below the national average. Universities can prepare more Oregonians for well-paid jobs in health care, STEM fields science, technology, engineering, mathematics, advanced manufacturing and professional-technical careers. And we should take advantage of the growing demographic and political strength of the Latino community by working together to provide access to college and to family-wage jobs.  Above all, Oregon must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000. As a result, fewer Oregonians are going to college. Like many, my grandparents and parents sacrificed so that I could be the first in my family to go to college. For the first time in Oregon's history, my generation is better educated than the generation that is now college age.  New university board members can raise scholarship funds so that more Oregonians can graduate from UO, PSU and OSU. But these board members should also help increase philanthropy at Southern, Western, Eastern and the Oregon Institute of Technology. All Oregonians from every part of the state should have a chance to achieve their potential and contribute to our state.  Finally, we must understand that philanthropy alone cannot produce excellent universities with innovative research, quality instruction and access for all Oregonians. The Legislature has consistently balanced the budget on the backs of students, forcing tuition increases. New board members have the power to reverse this practice and to force major public investments in our universities for the good of Oregon. Let us work together to apply that power to building an affordable and accessible world-class university system.  Jim Francesconi is a member of the State Board of Higher Education and lives in Northeast Portland.",partially false
b57fd483,"Gas prices have dropped, but in N.Y. state they're still pretty high","BUFFALO, N.Y. WKBW — As people stay home to help stop the spread of the coronavirus, the price of gas has slowly started to drop.  But in New York State, that’s not saying much.  That’s because New York is one of only 12 states where the average gallon of gas costs more than $2.00, according to numbers provided by the AAA of Western and Central New York.  Nationally, the average price of a gallon of gas is $1.77, compared to $2.89 a year ago.  In New York State, it's $2.18 per gallon, compared to $2.96 a year ago.  In Buffalo, gas is now $2.23 per gallon, compared to $2.88 a year ago.  “The oil prices have a direct impact on what we pay at the pump, so with these low oil prices and this low demand for gasoline right now, we're just seeing gas prices drop,” said Elizabeth Carey, spokeswoman for the AAA.  Oil demand first started to drop in China, she said, and government directives for the coronavirus now have people stuck at home here.  “Gas has been coming down for nine straight weeks since this all began,” Carey said of the outbreak and traveling restrictions.  But some motorists wonder why Western New Yorkers are not seeing more of a break here in local gas prices.  One 7 Eyewitness News viewer wrote, The gas stations will up their prices the second gas goes up even though the gas in the tanks was purchased at a lower market value. Are we paying over a dollar in taxes in NYS or are they gouging?  Another wrote, Why is gas on the reservation 97 cents? Add 46 cents taxes [and] why are we not paying $1.43 a [gallon] on regular gas stations? We [are] getting ripped off.  “You have to consider the New York State taxes,” Carey said.  That's right: she said higher gas prices are just a reality for motorists living in the Empire State. New Yorkers pay $0.65 in taxes for every gallon of gas they buy, and more than $0.45 are state taxes.  “Compare that to Ohio,” she said. “They charge about half of that in their state taxes. So their prices are much lower.”  By the time New Yorkers head back to work, she said, prices will likely start creeping back up.  “[If] they start raising that work-from-home limit, yeah, prices are going to go up,” she said. “There'll be a higher demand, but it's hard to say how much.”",true
62e4d9e5,Many Studies Find That Cloth Masks Do Not Stop Viruses Like COVID,"A thorough marketing campaign for the use of low-quality masks has convinced millions of people that masks will reduce COVID-19 spread, but do they really?  State governments are enthusiastically mandating that everyone, even those who aren’t sick, wear masks when in public. While that might seem like a logical and even patriotic thing to do, what does the science actually say about mask efficacy and safety?  Top Doctors Initially Acknowledged Masks Don’t Work  In the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak, Dr. Anthony Fauci told us masks probably weren’t going to help protect us from the Wuhan virus. Joe Biden’s COVID-19 adviser Dr. Michael Osterholm similarly agreed that wearing masks is “largely” nonsense and that “trying to stop the flu [another respiratory virus] is like trying to stop the wind.”  These expert opinions were based on a meta-analysis of multiple studies about masks on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC’s website. It concluded, “We did not find evidence that surgical-type face masks are effective in reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza transmission, either when worn by infected persons source control or by persons in the general community to reduce their susceptibility.”  Fauci and Osterholm were also likely aware of numerous studies concluding that masks during surgery don’t prevent wound infections from particles doctors emitted from their mouths and noses. One study found that tracer particles placed on the inside of a surgeon’s mask ended up in the surgical wound.  Another study in Clinical Orthopedics blamed redirected airflow, saying, “The wearing of a surgical face mask had no effect upon the overall operating room environmental contamination and probably work only to redirect the projectile effect of talking and breathing.” Most recently, a September 2020 meta-review concluded, “Surgical mask wearing among individuals in non-healthcare settings is not significantly associated with reduction in acute respiratory illness incidence in this meta-review.”  Much Recent Pro-Mask Research Is Deeply Flawed  The only statistically significant data on preventing viral spread is for N95 masks worn indoors when one can’t socially distance, which is not the type of mask required nor typically worn by the general public.  In favor of a few new, poorly designed studies, government leaders are ignoring the previous solid research that clearly demonstrates the typical cloth masks don’t work. The researchers in these new inferior studies somehow conclude that masks help, but you have to read the fine print: They have an unrealistic experimental design, confounding variables, and a “low certainty” of evidence.  Speaking of fine print, while the World Health Organization WHO recommends masks to the public, it acknowledges elsewhere, “At the present time, the widespread use of masks by healthy people in the community setting is not yet supported by high quality or direct scientific evidence.”  One analysis published in the well-known medical journal The Lancet concluded masks help, but the study subjects wore masks along with all other protective health measures, meaning the contribution of masks to the study result can’t be conclusive. To its credit, it rated its evidence on masks as “low certainty,” yet this study is held up as “proof” that masks work.  Other studies, such as one from Nature, had participants blow into a tube or a box while wearing and not wearing various masks. If fewer particles were emitted from the front of the mask, researchers deemed that mask to be effective. That would be great, except measuring only the forward projection of particles completely misses the aerosols that escape from the edges of the mask. A person’s fogged glasses are a clear demonstration that masks do little to contain aerosols. Masks simply “redirect airflow,” as the Clinical Orthopedics study stated.  Another “definitive” study put rats in adjacent cages separated by a small hole completely covered by a new, dry mask. This experiment does not come close to approximating the effectiveness of the moist, bacteria-laden masks people wear in public, which leak aerosols out of the edges. Comparing masks covering rat air holes to those covering human faces is comparing apples and oranges.  All of these studies also used fresh masks only for a few minutes. The authors acknowledge that when masks get moistened by breath, they might allow for increased emission of viral particles. Indeed, it has been well demonstrated that masks accumulate microorganisms.  Finally, in one case study, a pair of COVID-19-infected hairdressers worked with masks, and their clients didn’t become ill. While this case is also widely viewed as proof masks work, important details were ignored.  First, many of the hairdressers’ clients declined to get tested, so we don’t know if they contracted COVID after contact with the hairdressers. Second, the clients who were in contact with the stylists when their viral load would have been highest were not included in this case study. Third, the hairdressers obviously had mild cases, otherwise they wouldn’t have been able to nor allowed to work.  When did the science bar get so low, especially for something forced on the entire population?  Are Masks Actually Causing Harm?  “Maskne,” face rashes, “mask mouth,” and sore throats point to bacteria building up in masks due to the humid, stagnant air and changes in the oral microbiome, which can cause systemic inflammation and downstream disease. A 2015 study found that health-care workers who wore cotton face masks suffered from significantly more respiratory illness than those who wore surgical masks.  Previous research conducted by Fauci himself found that the main cause of death in the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic was from bacterial pneumonia. Inhaling higher bacterial counts with every breath sounds like an especially bad idea.  The WHO specifically recommends against wearing a mask while exercising because “masks may reduce the ability to breathe comfortably. Sweat can make the mask become wet more quickly which makes it difficult to breathe and promotes the growth of microorganisms.”  Abundant research demonstrates masks cannot help prevent the spread of coronavirus, while much recent research claiming to support masks is weak and poorly designed. Frequent mask use by the general population increases bacteria and dust in our mouth and airways. A government mandating that everyone wear a mask based on such low-quality evidence is reckless and potentially harmful.  For now, let’s stick with the measures that do help: social distancing, hand hygiene, and avoiding chronic disease. Only don a fresh, clean N95 mask for short periods of time when you’re unavoidably close to others indoors.",false
fb238099,"Russia exposes Covid-19 with Scientific Data as a Hoax, says its a Fake Pandemic","Home » Biology, Breaking News, Health, North America, Science, Statistics / Polls » Russia exposes Covid-19 with Scientific Data as a Hoax, says its a Fake Pandemic  Russia has just released very important data which basically makes Coronavirus a fake pandemic. Moscow authorities have stated that at least 12.5% of its residents have developed antibodies to Covid-19, after taking samples from 50,000 people. It’s just the beginning of a massive survey that will see millions tested.  Moscow has a population of 12.5 million people and if 12.5% of them have antibodies, that would be 1,562,500 people already had Covid-19 and recovered without any symptoms or any treatment whatsoever. Of these, 1,934 have died. This means Covid-19 death rate is at about 0.12%, not much bigger than the ordinary A/H1N1 flu.  In fact the A/H1N1 flu is more deadly because it spreads at least 10 times faster and easier than Covid-19.  Even though A/H1N1 has a smaller death rate of about 0.04%, its much deadlier because it spreads faster and easier than Covid-19. We now know for a fact that this whole thing is a giant hoax, the biggest hoax in the history of mankind, far surpassing other past hoaxes like the 9/11 or the holocaust.  Despite having a very low death rate, Russia is now suspecting that not even all of those 1,934 Muscovites died of Covid-19 so they said that they will run autopsies to determine the exact cause of death, so expect the numbers to become even lower after they finish with the autopsies.  Here’s what Moscow’s Department of Health said:  “It’s impossible in other COVID-19 cases to name the cause of death. So, for example in over 60% of deaths the cause was clearly for different reasons such as vascular failures such as heart attacks, stage 4 malignant diseases, leukaemia, systemic diseases which involve organ failure, and other incurable fatal diseases.”  Belarus and Sweden refused to lockdown their citizens yet their death rates have also been tiny compared to other countries like the United States which has been exposed many times for faking the numbers.  Romania has also been caught faking the numbers, even bribing their citizens to declare that their relatives died of Covid-19. While Russia did not specifically said those words that this is a “hoax” and a “fake pandemic”, this is exactly what their data is showing, we had to use that title to draw attention to a very serious problem which is of concern to everyone.  Let’s not forget that this plandemic has resulted in job loss, poverty, bankrupcies and worse of all, suicides. Who the F will be held accountable for all the young people who suicided because of muh coronavirus hoax?  Now question… what about the poisonous vaccine which is about to be rolled out, they’re saying that they want everyone forcefully vaccinated… Including the people who already had coronahoax virus and recovered and are now immune??? If yes, isn’t it clear how much of a giant hoax this whole thing is?  Additionally, there is also an Official German COVID Secret Report Leak which Denounces Virus as ‘Global False Alarm’.

be3dcbd7,Computers are getting better than humans at reading,"The robots are coming, and they can read.  Artificial intelligence programs built by Alibaba BABA and Microsoft MSFT have beaten humans on a Stanford University reading comprehension test.  This is the first time that a machine has outperformed humans on such a test, Alibaba said in a statement Monday.  The test was devised by artificial intelligence experts at Stanford to measure computers' growing reading abilities. Alibaba's software was the first to beat the human score.  Related: Google is opening an artificial intelligence center in China  Luo Si, the chief scientist of natural language processing at the Chinese company's AI research group, called the milestone a great honor, but also acknowledged that it will likely lead to a significant number of workers losing their jobs to machines.  The technology can be gradually applied to numerous applications such as customer service, museum tutorials and online responses to medical inquiries from patients, decreasing the need for human input in an unprecedented way, Si said in a statement.  Alibaba has already put the technology to work on Singles Day, the world's biggest shopping bonanza, by using computers to answer a large number of customer service questions.  In a tweet, Pranav Rajpurkar, one of the Stanford researchers who developed the reading test, called Alibaba's feat a great start to 2018 for artificial intelligence.  Related: These three countries are winning the global robot race  The Stanford test generates questions about a set of Wikipedia articles.  For example, a human or AI program reads a passage about the history of British TV show Doctor Who and then answers questions like, What is Doctor Who's space ship called? Spoiler alert: It's the TARDIS, for non-Doctor Who fans out there.  Alibaba's deep neural network model scored 82.44 on the test on January 11, narrowly beating the 82.304 scored by the human participants. A day later, Microsoft's AI software also beat the human score, with a result of 82.650.  These kinds of tests are certainly useful benchmarks for how far along the AI journey we may be, said Andrew Pickup, a spokesman for Microsoft. However, the real benefit of AI is when it is used in harmony with humans, he added.  Facebook FB, Tencent TCEHY and Samsung SSNLF have also previously submitted AI models to the Stanford project.

e22f9df0,"Report: Other countries faring better against COVID due to hydroxychloroquine, not lockdowns","PETITION: Tell the FDA to reverse its opposition to Hydroxychloroquine and help save lives! Sign the petition here.  September 26, 2020 LifeSiteNews – While Democrats and the mainstream media routinely attribute the United States’ relatively high number COVID-19 deaths to Americans’ failure to uniformly wear masks or “socially distance,” a new report suggests the true culprit may be the country’s unwillingness to embrace the drug hydroxychloroquine HCQ.  The United States is estimated to have seen 7.1 million COVID-19 cases as of September 25, with more than 200,000 deaths and 4.4 million recoveries. Officially it has the most cases in the world though that ranking is likely due in part to the authoritarian government of China’s refusal to share accurate numbers.  HCQ has long been approved for use in treating malaria, arthritis, and certain autoimmune conditions, but its potential applications to the coronavirus became a political lightning rod after President Donald Trump first called attention to early studies indicating its potential. The FDA initially issued an Emergency Use Authorization EUA allowing it to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile SNS but revoked that authorization in June, claiming “new information” indicated the potential dangers outweighed any potential effectiveness.  However, a white paper published this month by the Economic Standard argues that the primary roadblocks to HCQ are political rather than scientific.  “The U.S. is an international outlier on HCQ,” the paper says. “Right now, doctors around the world are prescribing HCQ to treat COVID-19 outside of hospitals, as well as prophylactically to prevent infection among healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. This paper argues that HCQ has met the appropriate burden of proof and urges members of the U.S. news media, public health community, and regulatory agencies to stop politicizing the use of this medicine. Tens of thousands of lives still hang in the balance.”  The paper lists more than two dozen medical conditions for which HCQ is an established treatment, which it says “reflect a general medical consensus, long predating the COVID-19 pandemic, that HCQ is a safe, well-tolerated drug.”  “In the U.S. alone from 2007-2017, patients received around 59 million prescriptions for HCQ,” the paper explains. “In over seven decades of use, there have been a handful of reports of fatal arrhythmias due to torsades de pointes from all drug causes, and zero reports of fatal arrhythmias with HCQ use. Most cases of arrhythmia involved extraordinary circumstances, including overdoses and patients with end-stage liver failure. Other side effects, such as retinopathy and kidney damage, result only from years of long-term use and have been described as ‘rare.’”  HCQ was identified as a potential COVID-19 treatment relatively early in the outbreak, and has been used in China, South Korea, France, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Malaysia, Bahrain, Poland, Russia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines, “among many others,” the report says. Yet the United States remains an “international outlier on HCQ, as one of just a handful of countries that have moved to limit – rather than expand – patient access to the drug.”  This, it continues, was due in part to the American news media focusing on “low-quality or botched RTCs [randomized controlled trials] – misrepresenting these as the ‘gold standard’ – while dismissing observational studies as irrelevant due to supposed biases...This narrative was sustained and amplified by scientists, academics, and government agency staff,” with possibly the most egregious example being a notorious study published in The Lancet that the esteemed medical journal was forced to retract after the data sources turned out to be fraudulent.  “A Google News search for the words ‘unproven’ and ‘hydroxychloroquine’ in reports published in April and May returned over 160 results, with most of these articles managing to work the adjective into headlines or opening sentences,” the paper goes on. “None of these reports mentioned that observational trials had discovered useful drugs in the past. Nor did they clarify that many observational studies in aggregate can yield more meaningful results than any one single study, RCTs included.”  Last month, three Republican senators sent a letter to U.S. Food & Drug Administration FDA Commissioner Alex Azar this month demanding an explanation as to why the agency revoked its approval of HCQ against the wishes of American doctors and the experiences of other countries.  LifeSiteNews’ petition calling on the FDA to drop its hostility to hydroxychloroquine has so far collected more than 49,000 signatures.

4c5839b3,HUGE! Attorney Sidney Powell CONFIRMS Alleged Dominion Servers in Germany Were Confiscated — VIDEO,"Last week Rep. Louie Gohmert told Chris Salcedo on Newsmax that people on the ground in Germany report that Scytl, which hosted elections data improperly through Spain, was raided by a large US ARMY force and their servers were seized in Frankfurt. The video went viral. Here is what Rep. Louie Gohmert R-TX had to say about this alleged raid earlier today. TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO We later posted more information we received from our source on this raid in Germany. From our source: The US government, once they determined that this Dominion server was involved in switching votes, then the intelligence community began a search for the server and discovered that the server was in Germany. In order to get access to that server and have it available for use in a legal manner they had to have the State Department work in tandem with the Department of Justice. They had to request that the government of Germany cooperate in allowing this seizure of this server. The appropriate documents required to affect that kind of seizure were put in place, signed off on, and it appears there was also US military support in this operation. The US military was not in the lead. But this helps explain why Esper was fired and Miller and Kash Patel were put in place — so that the military would not interfere with the operation in any way. By getting ahold of the server they now are going to have the direct evidence of when they were instructed to stop counting. They will also discover who gave the direction to stop counting and who initiated the algorithm that started switching votes. The CIA was completely excluded from this operation.

bb1342bc,"Late diagnosis of lung cancer hitting survival rate, study says","People with lung cancer are dying after being diagnosed late in A&E because their GP missed signs of the disease despite often repeated visits, experts have revealed.  As many as 56% of people in some parts of England who get lung cancer are only diagnosed when they visit A&E, according to a report by the UK Lung Cancer Coalition.  They are five times more likely to die within a year than those whose condition has been identified either by their GP or through the NHS cancer screening programme.  Family doctors often fail to diagnose cases of lung cancer until it is too late to treat effectively or miss them altogether, leading patients to seek help at A&E, the report says.  More than a third of lung cancer patients see their GP three or more times before being referred for tests. That is a key factor in the UK’s poor record, in international terms, at diagnosing the disease early.  Lung cancer is the third commonest form of cancer in the UK and the biggest cancer killer, claiming 35,000 lives a year.  “People diagnosed in A&E are dying as a result of delays in identifying their illness. Late diagnosis makes lung cancer harder to treat and is a major reason why we have such poor survival in the UK,” said Prof Mick Peake, chair of the coalition’s clinical advisory group.  It is “a travesty” that admission to hospital as a medical emergency is the single commonest way the disease is diagnosed, added Peake, who is also the clinical director of the Centre for Cancer Outcomes at University College Hospital London.  GPs’ failure to spot symptoms of lung cancer is only one reason for Britain’s low rate of early diagnosis and high rate of lung cancer mortality, Peake stressed.  However, he added: “There is good evidence that there are missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis in primary care and we strongly urge GPs to have a low threshold for doing a chest X-ray or CT scan in patients where there is any suspicion of lung cancer.”  Patients’ reluctance to have symptoms, such as a persistent cough, checked out can delay diagnosis too, especially those from poorer households and older people.  NHS data cited by Peake shows a postcode lottery in which Tower Hamlets in east London has the highest proportion of patients whose disease is diagnosed in A&E – 56.2% – closely followed by Manchester 56.1% and Leeds south and east 54%.  More than 50% of patients are also diagnosed in A&E in Salford, Hull, South Tyneside and Sunderland.  In contrast, only 14.7% of sufferers in Guildford and Waverley in Surrey are diagnosed that way, with low rates also in Wokingham in Berkshire 15.7% and Harrogate 16%.  Dr Moira Fraser-Pearce, director of policy, campaigns and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said that staff shortages in NHS cancer services and heavy workloads were exacerbating the complex reasons for the high level of diagnosis in A&E.  Macmillan has helped NHS England develop a new way of screening smokers and other high-risk patients for lung cancer by offering tests in trucks, often situated in supermarket car parks.  The NHS did not comment directly on the findings but a spokesperson said that: “The NHS is catching more cancers earlier when they are easier to treat, resulting in record lung cancer survival rates.”  Targeted lung health checks in locations such as supermarket car parks will detect “thousands more cases of cancer that might not have been detected otherwise, saving even more lives”, they added.  NHS England has pledged to diagnose three in four cases of cancer at an early stage by 2028. Currently 57% of lung cancers are diagnosed late, greatly reducing chance of survival.",false
a92a5031,Senate Republican Leader Ortt And Republican Conference Announce Plan to “Reset New York State”,"Comprehensive Plan Includes Proposals to Restart our Local Economies, Rethink How New York State Operates, and Renew our Commitment to Residents  As the Legislative session is set to begin this week, Senate Republican Leader Robert Ortt and members of the Republican Conference today unveiled a comprehensive vision to Reset New York.  The plan includes several components to address mounting economic and fiscal challenges facing the State -- many of which were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic -- and to help forge a better path forward for all New Yorkers.  “Under New York’s one-party control, we have seen a dramatic and unwelcome shift in our state’s priorities. Democrats displayed no interest in rebuilding our local economy, lessening the financial burden on our middle class, or stemming the ever-increasing outflow of New York residents fleeing our state. They sought to release dangerous criminals into our communities, undermine our law enforcement, and waste millions of dollars on progressive agenda items. The COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted the need for immediate action on the unresolved challenges facing our small business community and New York’s hardworking taxpayers,” said Senate Republican Leader Robert Ortt.  The Senate Republicans’ plan includes proposals that prioritize restarting our local economies, rethinking how New York State operates, and renewing a commitment to New York State’s residents to ensure strong, robust communities.  Restart our Local Economies by:  · Safely reopening our small businesses to help them get back on their feet and offer gainful employment for residents;  · Helping our schools and colleges stay open; and  · Investing in our physical and human infrastructure to rebuild our state’s competitiveness.  Rethink how New York State Operates by:  · Ending New York State’s unaffordability problem, which has been made worse by the pandemic;  · Taking on State government’s culture of overspending and restoring fiscal responsibility; and  · Reasserting the Legislature’s constitutional authority as an equal branch of government.  Renew our Commitment to Residents by:  · Fostering the growth of vibrant local communities;  · Developing a robust economy with diverse opportunities; and  · Creating safer neighborhoods with common sense public safety measures.  “New York government is failing its people. Broken policies have made New York more expensive, less safe and have diminished the quality of life for our residents. We need to change course before it is too late,” said Deputy Leader Andrew Lanza.  “Throughout this pandemic, there seems to have been little interest from New York’s one-party leadership in stepping up and taking an active legislative role in constructively combating the pandemic by putting our communities’ safety and livelihoods at the forefront of legislative policy. I’m proud to join my colleagues in offering actual solutions to help us rise to meet the challenges ahead. I call on my colleagues across the political spectrum to join us as we work toward ending this terrible crisis and rebuilding our state for the better,” said Senator Fred Akshar.  “While New York State once stood tall in our nation as a pillar of economic strength, educational excellence and public policy innovation, its leadership today is more dubious. High taxes, excessive, job-killing regulations, and a rising crime rate have made us number one in population loss, and a misguided focus on politically driven agendas has diverted precious resources away from our core responsibilities. With the added challenges created by the pandemic, the future of our state hangs in the balance. If there was ever a compelling case to rethink and change course, this is it,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Long before the COVID-19 pandemic turned our world upside down, New York faced daunting challenges, including a looming budget deficit and a shrinking population. The corona virus has exacerbated our problems, adding to the financial burden we face and bringing our economy and many small businesses to the brink. As we fight the pandemic, we must also safely re-open our economy, control spending, ease the burden on taxpayers and restore our system of checks and balances in state government,” said Senator Patrick M. Gallivan.  “We have seen an exodus of New York residents, families and businesses who have fled the state for better opportunities elsewhere because of unwelcome policies, burdensome regulations and high taxes. Substantive and dramatic change is needed, especially at a time when the state’s fiscal challenges have been significantly exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. This plan refocuses the state’s priorities and helps to build a better and brighter future for New York,” said Senator Joseph Griffo.  “Together we can restore New York to its rightful status as the Empire State. To accomplish this we must work with our small business owners, farmers and other job creators. My focus is on getting New York open for business and helping people get back to work safely. This common sense package would help the communities I represent and put our state on the road to real economic recovery and future prosperity,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “Overcoming the unprecedented, ongoing health, economic, and community challenges posed by COVID-19 requires big, bold solutions. We need to rethink the state’s approach to solving problems, successfully restart our economy, and renew our commitment to residents and each other. Partisan politics and a bureaucratic Albany trapped in the old ways of doing things won’t work. What will work is advancing smarter public policies that recognize the breadth and depth of our challenges and the necessity of fresh thinking that goes beyond party labels. It’s time for our state to hit the reset button, and it begins with the priorities and principles we are unveiling today. Our Reset New York State plan reflects our continued efforts to bring New Yorkers together and improve the quality of life across our state. We are ready to answer the challenges of COVID and deliver the positive change New Yorkers expect and rightfully deserve,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “Between July 2019 and July 2020, New York State led the nation in at least one thing- people moving out. The pandemic only accelerated a trend that was already in place. High taxes and an unfriendly business climate are the real culprits. Our small businesses need help and our state needs a new direction. We already know what works from other states that are growing and not shrinking. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel, instead we need a reset. Senate Republicans have a plan to do just that and I'm proud to support it,” said Senator Michael Martucci.  “As our state begins to emerge from the current crisis, it is vital that we start immediately working together to make our state’s future brighter than the past. The ‘Reset New York’ plan reflects the priorities of hardworking New Yorkers and I am proud to join with my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference to make sure their voices are heard in Albany. The challenges our state faces are not new but the solutions must be – and finding them must be our main focus,” said Senator Mario Mattera.  “I look forward throughout this new legislative session to our Senate Republican Conference giving voice to the need for rebuilding local economies, focusing on stronger and safer communities, and resisting what threatens to be a devastating expansion of a business-as-usual, tax-and-spend direction in state government. This ‘Reset New York’ strategy begins our commitment to more fiscally responsible, commonsense government that works better for taxpayers, builds and protects livelihoods, honors public safety and security, and focuses like never before on the restoration of Upstate’s rightful place in New York government,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “New York is facing true challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic is one reason for our struggles, but wayward state policies that fail to meet the needs of our small businesses, families, and taxpayers, are the real culprit. There is no margin for error and the time is now to change course by enacting the Reset New York agenda. Specifically, broadband access, support for our farmers, and a strong educational system are among the initial building blocks that can set us on the right path. Let’s enact policies that create opportunities, not those that confine us,” said Senator Peter Oberacker.  “Long Island’s families, businesses and seniors are hurting and need greater support and relief from state government, both in the immediate term to help get through the pandemic and in the future to ensure that New York is a more affordable and safer place to call home. Reset New York will put us on a trajectory to accomplish these goals and begin to reverse the trends of higher taxes, burdensome regulations, and more crime that has caused hundreds of thousands of residents to flee the Empire State,” said Senator Anthony Palumbo.  “New York is in desperate need of a reset. The pandemic has highlighted and exasperated the issues that our state has faced for decades. We continue to lose residents and jobs, with our high taxes and over regulations. Our communities are suffering. Small businesses, restaurants and family farms are struggling to stay afloat. We need to provide real answers and solutions to help our local economies and save our struggling communities. We can no longer ignore these glaring issues. New Yorkers need results now,” said Senator Ed Rath.  “In recent years, people have been fleeing New York State due to high taxes, a lack of opportunity, and red tape that hinders business growth. The pandemic has only made matters worse and now, more than ever, our state needs a reset. From reenergizing our small businesses to making New York more affordable for hardworking taxpayers, my colleagues and I are committed to fighting for changes that will improve our state in the wake of this unprecedented pandemic,” said Senator Patty Ritchie.  “Despite the unprecedented challenges that our communities are facing, New Yorkers have remained resilient, and now more than ever, they need a government determined to deliver results. If we want to rebuild our state, we have to start by resetting the state's priorities and ensuring that the needs of hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers are firmly at the top. I am proud to join with my colleagues to reaffirm our commitment to that goal and to do all that we can to ensure that small businesses, middle class families, and struggling New Yorkers have a strong, independent voice on their side,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “There’s only one way forward and that’s to enable our businesses and communities, big and small, to have the best possible chance to recover. When the need for help is apparent, too often the response of government is to throw an anvil instead of a life-preserver into the water. We can’t make this harder with higher taxes and more unreasonable demands. Our vision must show that we are listening. That’s what this is about,” said Senator Dan Stec.  “As we begin a New Year and new legislative session, our top priority must continue to be addressing the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic so we can stop the spread of the virus, save lives and safely reopen our economy. In order to reset New York State by safely restarting our economy, we need to address the elephant in the room that our state government is not talking about: the fact that for the third year in a row, New York leads the nation in outmigration of residents, with 126,000 people leaving last year and over one million in the past decade. When enough people who can afford to leave New York State are gone, who will be left to pay for the infrastructure, health care, schools and other necessities? I look forward to joining with Leader Ortt and my colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference in the coming weeks and months to address these issues and put forth policies to turn things around so the Empire State does not become the ‘Empty State,’” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “I look forward to joining my Senate Republican Conference colleagues in advancing our ambitious Reset New York plan today. As we all work toward opening our State and local communities safely from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus must be on the economy, which starts with advancing policies that support small businesses, which are the backbones of our communities, jobs, public safety, improving our local infrastructure, and ensuring our schools get their fair share. One party control has pushed those priorities to the side and with our Reset New York plan, our Conference will ensure that the voices of our constituents are heard,” said Senator Alexis Weik.  ###",partially false
eaf36480,Stone touts Walker template in run for county executive,"SHARE  By of the  Republican state Rep. Jeff Stone of Greendale formally announced his bid to succeed Scott Walker as Milwaukee County executive Wednesday, saying he'd adhere closely to Walker's formula - keeping a tight lid on taxes, pushing for worker concessions and promoting job development.  Meanwhile Wednesday, Walker announced he will step down as county executive Dec. 27. That ensures that the special elections for his replacement can be held concurrent with spring elections - Feb. 15 for a primary, if needed, and April 5 for the runoff - and avoid costs of a separate election.  Serving the residents of Milwaukee County for the last eight years has been an honor, Walker said in the statement.  Stone joins what could become a crowded field, with several other legislators, county supervisors and even former county executive Tom Ament pondering a run for the remaining year of Walker's term as county executive. Stone, however, becomes the first of the higher-profile prospects to announce he'll run and is the only Republican office holder among a lengthening list of possible candidates for the nonpartisan job.  We need to look at all options to keep our county financially viable - any option except raising taxes, Stone said from his newly opened campaign office in Wauwatosa. He stressed the importance of private-sector solutions to problems in the local economy and said job creation would go a long way toward improving the county's financial condition.  Stone, 49, said he'd be a vital link for the county with Walker in the governor's office and Republicans who will run both houses of the Legislature next year. He praised Walker's tenure as county executive and noted he once carpooled to the Capitol with Walker when they served together in the Assembly.  He differs from Walker in having a background steeped in business, said Stone, who has run a printing business for 27 years. Stone said Walker's era as county executive began with a focus of reforming government, while his emphasis will be on expanding the economy.  Stone made a pitch for harmony with the County Board, which has frequently sparred with Walker. Stone also said he'd enlist the help of the local business community and others.  Though he spoke mostly in generalities, Stone said he wanted to develop a long-range plan for restoring the county to fiscal health.  His announcement drew criticism from Mike Tate, the state Democratic Party chairman, who said Stone would continue Walker policies and result in deeper financial problems. He said the party would spend thousands to help a Democratic or progressive candidate defeat Stone.  Stone said he expects to have to raise $800,000 or more to run a successful race. His campaign account now has a balance of nearly $13,000, state records show.  The lineup of potential candidates includes former Democratic state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, County Supervisors Johnny Thomas and Marina Dimitrijevic, County Clerk Joe Czarnezki, County Treasurer Dan Diliberti and Ament.  Holloway will temporarily succeed Walker as county executive but must appoint an interim executive within 30 days. Holloway has said he might appoint himself interim executive, which would mean he'd hold the office through the April 5 special election.",true
62d08539,Coronavirus: Activists in bizarre claim 5G could be acting as 'accelerator' for disease,"The Daily Star's FREE newsletter is spectacular! Sign up today for the best stories straight to your inbox Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later. Sign up today! Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Conspiracists are bizarrely claiming the UK could be hit harder by coronavirus because of the rollout of the 5G network, a claim that has been dismissed by scientists.  Currently there are 3,983 confirmed cases of Covid-19 across Britain and Northern Ireland.  As coronavirus has ripped across the globe, a new conspiracy theory has found an eager audience: that the symptoms of the virus - high fever, coughing and shortness of breath - are actually the human body responding to exposure to 5G.  The theory has been shot down by experts, who have pointed out that coronavirus cases have been identified in many areas with no 5G networks.  Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto  Anti-5G critics based in the UK accept the virus likely began in a market in Wuhan and travelled here through human transmission. But they bizarrely believe the 5G networks helps the spread of the virus.  But they're concerned the ultra-fast network currently operating in almost 100 locations around Britain could be helping it to spread more quickly, despite a lack of scientific proof to stand up their unfounded claims.  Activist Louise Thomas, based in Somerset, told Daily Star Online: We can't say 5G has caused the coronavirus, but it might be exacerbating it.  Tanja Rebel, another activist and philosophy lecturer at the Isle of Wight College, told us: Many studies show that Electro-Magnetic Radiation EMR suppresses the immune system and that it helps viruses and bacteria thrive.  So EMR and in particular 5G could act as an accelerator for the disease. We do not know for sure, but common sense and the precautionary principle decree that we urgently need a moratorium on the roll-out of 5G until we can show that it is safe.  Public Health England PHE has publicly stated there is no convincing evidence that exposure to radiation at a level below the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation guidelines will cause adverse health effects.  That safe level is 300GHz, while the level of radiation from 5G will likely only be as high as the tens of GHz.  PHE has been approached for comment on these specific claims from activists.  The new 5G network is being rolled out incrementally across the UK  The “precautionary principle” says that governments and societies should react with caution to anything with the potential to cause catastrophic damage which is not yet well-understood by science.  Italy, now the country with the highest coronavirus death toll, had 5G networks installed in five cities in 2019 with plans to extend coverage throughout 2020. However Iran, which has also been badly affected by the pandemic, has no 5G networks at all, disputing this theory.  A 2011 study from Northeastern University in Boston indicated that some single-celled bacteria, such as E.coli, may communicate with each other using radio waves.  Very little is known about Covid-19, the novel coronavirus at the heart of the current pandemic, but research has shown that viruses talk to each other when making decisions about infecting a host.  Activists are now calling for the government to put a stop to the 5G rollout in what they believe to be the interests of public health, despite repeated assurances from experts that the network radiation poses no threat.  Especially in today's situation it is paramount that we do not play further with lives, Rebel said. Anything else would be deeply reckless.  There have been reports of 5G masts being vandalised and telecoms engineers harassed by member of the public who believe the coronavirus conspiracy theory.  Communications regulator Ofcom has warned this behaviour poses a serious threat to people's safety, adding: We would like to emphasise that there is no relationship whatsoever between 5G mobile signals and the coronavirus.  Vandalism to mobile phone masts mean other services using those masts stop working. These services could include 3G, 4G and mobile call services.  This means people can't call the emergency services or contact their family. It could also mean that some of the communications equipment used by the emergency services is unable to work properly.

83f8a888,AOC:’Children Should Be Raised By The State’,"Democrat spokesperson, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, continues to push her socialist agenda and now it’s getting downright scary. Her latest genius plan is to socialize our children. That’s right, apparently AOC feels that upon birth, the offspring of American families should be taken from their homes to be raised by the state “so that they can do properly indoctrinated and become model citizens for a new and better American future.”  This is straight out of the Soviet playbook where children were routinely removed from households and molded into various roles for government. They were treated as possessions, not people, while families mourned.  AOC suggested this when asked her thoughts on the plight of orphaned children throughout the country, currently at 50 year high.  “Our children are underused in this country. Or rather, improperly used. They say children are the future. That is absolutely right. They hold the promise to shape the future of our nation. This can be positive or negative. Orphans are in the right place. Government can begin their training early. All kids should go to government. By staying with family, children are fed varieties of information. There’s no consistency from one household to the next. This is counterproductive to the societal good. In order to further the interests of the country and all it’s citizens, there needs to be common learning amongst all of the young. Child rearing taken over by the state can accomplish this while also providing a safe and healthy environment in which to grow. Surrendering your children to the state is really the highest form of patriotism there can be. It shows you love our country and are committed to building its success for generations to come.”  If another reason was ever needed to join the fight against socialism, this is it. A system that would destroy families by taking away their children is not one that is consistent with American values. Don’t let it happen here.",false
89119dbc,Liberals and BLM Petition to Change the Name of the White House,"The movement to strip history and heritage is reaching new levels of ridiculous heights. Liberals along with Black Lives Matter have started a petition that has over 25 million signatures to change the name of the White House to The People’s House, stating that “White” is oppressive and racist.  The White House has been named the White House since 1901 when Theodore Roosevelt named it that during his presidency. The change is being demanded after weeks of racial strife and protests across the United States.  The petition, which started last week, already has enough signatures to be forwarded to the White House and if it reaches 100 million it can become law!!! We must stop these hoodlums!!!  The liberals have been doing everything that they can to remove anything that they consider to be racist or offensive. Like the confederate flag, or nooses, or other symbols of actual racism that most trump supporters think are good and wholesome.  Like Trump himself, who really is a racist piece of trash. Joe Barron, who was one of the first to sign the petition says it really is the “People’s House,” even though that big fat windbag currently occupies it.  These liberal leftists will stop at nothing to try and dismantle the racist history they say this nation was founded on. No matter what it is, they want it down, and it looks like they’re getting what they want. And conservatives across the country are none too happy about it.  They reminisce of a time where being openly racist was ok and the norm and thought that with the election of Trump, we’d be going back to that.  Well, they were wrong. Just as wrong as those symbols of hate were then, just like they are now. That history is finally being erased, and not at a moment too soon.",false
4684f622,Is It True that Chief Justice John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island?,"Introduction  Many conservatives have been confused by John Roberts’ decisions as Chief Justice of SCOTUS. On decision after decision, he has followed the line of thinking common to the radical left. Yes, we have Kavanaugh, Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, and now ACB on our side and that is great. But Roberts was appointed by Bush. He was supposed to be a conservative justice. Why has he not acted like it, especially recently? One potential reason is that it might be true that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  Now, I’m not a conspiracy theorist. Yes, I’m concerned about the brazen voter fraud in the election, especially the votes Biden received from non-citizens. Yes, I think the Hunter Biden emails are real and I think Biden might have worn a wire during the first debate. And no, I don’t think Epstein killed himself. But, other than the wire, those aren’t really conspiracy theories. They are things that happened. I think the same is true of me saying that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island. I might be wrong, but the evidence is damning.      Think your mask is completely useless, just like John Roberts? Mad at your governor’s Covid policies?

Become one here: Patreon Donation Link  What We Know: It Sure Looks Like Justice John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island and Might Have Been or Still Could Be Blackmailed  For those that have been living under a rock, it came to light a few years ago that Jeffrey Epstein had an island in the Caribbean where he took elites to have sex with children. Various famous and prominent men, namely Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew, visited frequently. Hollywood elites, such as Kevin Spacey, also visited.  The main theory about that island and Epstein’s wealth is that, in addition to just being a sick and twisted individual, Epstein blackmailed the people he brought to the island. Perhaps he did that for money, perhaps for fame, or perhaps for power. The “why” isn’t known yet and probably won’t be until Ghislaine Maxwell’s trial.  But what we do know is that Epstein brought famous and influential individuals to his island and had ample evidence with which he could blackmail them. One of those individuals might have been Chief Justice Roberts; it does look like Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and could have been blackmailed to make bad SCOTUS decisions. Here’s the evidence.  Piece of Evidence #1: The Flight Log  To determine who visited “pedo island,” one key piece of evidence has been the flight log. For example, a flight log from 2009 showed that Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Kevin Spacey and Naomi Campbell visited the island. You might remember that Kevin Spacey was accused of harassing a minor and there is ample evidence that Clinton and Prince Andrew also had inappropriate relations with minors.  Now, one interesting name on that list is a John Roberts. Here is what Lin Wood had to say about the idea that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and was on the flight manifest:  Additionally, there is this image of the flight log. If you view the circled area, you will see that a “John Roberts” signed it:  Now, there are, of course, potential refutations of that. Just because Lin Wood said so and there appears to be a flight log that shows so does not mean that Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  For one, the image could be faked. I completely understand that and want everyone else to too. I don’t have a copy of the flight log, so I can’t independently confirm it. However, the image does appear to be real and has not, to my knowledge, been discredited as of yet.  The other believable refutation is that the “John Roberts” listed is not the Chief Justice of SCOTUS. Both “John” and “Roberts” are common first and last names, so there could be another that was on the so-called Lolita Express.  But Epstein didn’t mingle with normal people. He only brought the elite of the elite to his island, and Chief Justice John Roberts is undoubtedly the most famous and influential “John Roberts” out there. Given the record of who Epstein brought to the island, it is likely, if the image is real and Lin Woods is right, that the John Roberts in Epstein’s flight log is Chief Justice John Roberts.  Piece of Evidence #2: Tapes and Pictures Appear to Show that John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island  According to one whistleblower about the heinous crimes of Epstein and his guests, Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island and can be seen in the Epstein tapes. Here is what one site, Penns Word, had to say:  “A whistleblower who allegedly works in the federal circuit revealed a Supreme Court justice was seen in various “Epstein tapes” that were recently recovered by investigators: “One of the SCOTUS [justices] is in the Epstein tapes that were recovered yesterday. I’m sure you can guess which one. “The shocking part is the canary is telling the feds a certain nation state has been blackmailing this gentleman since prior to his nomination to SCOTUS. “What does this mean? This justice was hand picked at the highest levels specifically because he was being controlled via blackmail. A sheep in wolf’s clothing appearing to be which he is not. “Cat is out of the bag… or I should say almost.”’ From: https://www.pennswordtwo.com/article/did-supreme-court-justice-john-roberts-just-get-fileted-by-the-epstein-tapes.html  Perhaps that whistleblower is lying. Or, perhaps, they’re telling the truth and John Roberts did appear at Epstein’s island. Lending credence to that view is an image that has leaked from those tapes. Here it is the others who are allegedly in the photo are, from left to right, Richard Cheaz, Bill Clinton, George Nader, and Tony Podesta:  This image is the clearest piece of evidence that John Roberts visited Epstein’s island  For reference, here is a picture of John Roberts from his swearing in that presents a similar profile:  Swearing in of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts.  Again, the image could be fake. Someone could have photoshopped John Roberts into the image. Or, it could be a real image with someone other than Chief Justice John Roberts in it. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Other than the haircut, the profile appears to be about the same. The nose, in particular, is strikingly similar, as is the general shape and profile of the face.  So, based on the whistleblower’s testimony and a leaked image, it does look like John Roberts visited Epstein’s island.  Conclusion: It Sure Looks Like John Roberts Visited Epstein’s Island  When the flight log, whistleblower testimony, and leaked image are all viewed, it is hard to not reach the conclusion that Chief Justice John Roberts visited Epstein’s island. Personally, I think the evidence is convincing, although I recognize that the images could be fake and the testimony made up.  But, if real, it would point to why John Roberts has made the decisions he has made since appointed. He has avoided contentious issues when possible because of blackmail or because he fears being in a situation where he could be blackmailed. When it came down to how to vote, he voted to the left because that’s what whoever blackmailed him told him to do. In short, it would appear that John Roberts is compromised and can’t be trusted to enforce constitutionality. He’ll just keep doing what his handlers tell him to do.

643feac4,"Rubio, Risch Statement On Senate Intelligence Committee Release Of Interrogation Study","Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Marco Rubio R-FL and Jim Risch R-ID issued the following statement regarding the impending declassification of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence release of a partisan report on CIA interrogation and detention programs:  “The one-sided report that will be released by Democrats on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence cost U.S. tax-payers over $40 million dollars to produce, and its authors never interviewed a single CIA official.  “It is unconscionable that the Committee and the White House would support releasing this report despite warnings from our allies, the U.S. State Department, and a new coordinated Intelligence Community document assessing the increased risk to the United States the release of this report poses. We are concerned that this release could endanger the lives of Americans overseas, jeopardize U.S. relations with foreign partners, potentially incite violence, create political problems for our allies, and be used as a recruitment tool for our enemies. Simply put, this release is reckless and irresponsible. We have written to the administration reminding them of these concerns.  “Congress has a legitimate and necessary role to play in conducting serious and constructive oversight of our intelligence agencies and capabilities. This report does not qualify as either serious or constructive. This was a partisan effort that divided members of the committee, and the committee against the people of the CIA. We voted against this report because it is flawed, and voted against declassifying this report because we believed that its release could put American lives at risk, be used to contribute to propaganda against the United States by our enemies, and damage U.S. foreign policy and counterterrorism efforts.  “The American civilian and uniformed personnel who worked tirelessly in the days and months after the September 11, 2001 attacks on our nation to keep us safe and prevent another mass casualty event deserve our eternal gratitude, not politically–motivated attacks. As a nation at war, we need a coherent detention and interrogation policy in order to extract valuable intelligence about terrorist networks from captured operatives. The Obama Administration has no detention policy, and it has hindered U.S. efforts to fight terrorism globally.”",partially false
d1db1b6c,Cuomo considers banning cigarette sales for six weeks amid Coronavirus outbreak,"Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a temporary six-week ban on the sale of combustible cigarettes in order to reduce the State’s Coronavirus death count, a source familiar with his thinking tells The Chronicle. The ban could come as soon as Monday and is expected to be included in a budget measure already scheduled to be announced.  New data out of Italy suggest that the nation’s whopping Coronavirus death rate — now approaching 10% of those who test positive — is highly correlated to cigarette use. Italian men smoke cigarettes at rates that far outpace most other developed countries, and the extreme shortage of ventilators there has been the cause of death for tens of thousands of smokers.  According to Italy’s National Health Institute, smokers with COVID-19 were one-third more likely to have a serious clinical situation than non-smokers. Half of these smokers required a ventilator.  For many weeks, it was observed that women in Italy are better able to overcome the virus than men. Italian doctors now believe that the statistical difference is attributable to smoking-related gender norms.  COVID-19 kills its victims by compromising the respiratory system and reducing oxygen levels in the blood. Regular cigarette use damages the airways and small air sacs in the lungs. Combustible cigarettes weaken smokers’ lungs by filling them with smoke and tar.  “When a smoker contracts COVID-19, he or she will be far more likely to suffer respiratory system failure, thereby exacerbating New York’s ventilator shortage,” Cuomo plans to say in remarks prepared for Monday. “Fortunately, medical science informs us that ex-smokers experience significant recovery in lung function and oxygen absorption as soon as they quit smoking.”  Former smokers recover 30% of their lung function just two weeks after quitting.  “Any ex-smoker can tell you how, just days after quitting, they were noticeably less out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Personally, I have heard hundreds of these stories,” he writes in draft remarks.  Dr. Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of Health, is prodding Cuomo to issue the temporary ban and discussed the issue with him privately earlier this week. Zucker has long advocated for additional restrictions on combustible cigarette sales, which causes more than 443,000 deaths annually — more deaths each year than from murder, car accidents, alcohol or drug use, suicides, and HIV combined.  It’s estimated that 81,000 people will die from COVID-19.  Zucker argues that a ban on cigarette sales for the duration of the outbreak will save thousands of lives and will reduce the State’s shortage of ventilators, perhaps by several thousand during its peak — expected to hit the State 21 days from today.  Therefore, the Governor’s advisors postulate, if New York takes immediate action and temporarily bans combustible cigarette sales during this public health crisis, ex-smokers’ respiratory systems will make significant recovery at the very same time that COVID-19 cases are peaking in New York.  “This will save lives, and not just the lives of smokers,” the Governor plans to say. “Every former smoker that gets sick, but does not need a ventilator, means one more ventilator is available to keep our aging parents and grandparents alive.”  “Importantly, we must also recognize that failing to temporarily ban combustible cigarettes immediately will cause a disproportionate increase in COVID-19 fatalities in minority communities, given the higher prevalence of immuno-deficiencies in these communities,” he plans to note.  The Governor’s supporters argue that it is more important now than ever to address the public health cost of combustible cigarettes — not just to save the lives of smokers, but to save the lives of all New Yorkers by mitigating the severity of a ventilator shortage.

98d4dc5a,New Regulation Requires 75 MPH Governor On All Motorcycles,"The government has implemented a new regulation requiring a governor to be placed on all motorcycles by mid-January 2017. The purpose of the mandatory governor would be to prevent motorcyclists from exceeding a speed of 75- miles per hour. The regulation aims to drastically reduce the amount of annual motorcycle fatalities in the United States.  Many are not surprised by the regulation as politicians have been asking for stricter safety features to be implemented on motorcycles for the past several decades. In 2014, the government offered all major motorcycle manufactures including Harley-Davidson, Yamaha, Honda, Ducati, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and BMW a large tax-incentive to begin implementing governors on all newly manufactured motorcycles, however to much surprise, all relevant manufactures declined to take advantage of the additional tax-incentive, requiring government officials to return to the drawing board.  Members of the U.S. Department of Transportation or U.D.O.T were supportive of the regulation and heavily involved in its roll-out. According to U.S. Department of Transportation representative James Littleton, the motorcycle governor regulation was long past due and made a comparison to the governors placed on traditional automobiles. Littleton told reporters during a press-conference that each year approximately 8,265 motorcycle fatalities occur throughout the United States. According to Littleton, the vast majority approximately 73% of motorcycle fatalities are the result of motorcyclists driving at unsafe speeds.  When asked why the regulation would only allow motorcyclists to maintain a speed below 75-miles per hour, Littleton made the following comment to reporters, “This is a crucial safety regulation that should have been implemented at least 20-years ago, now that we are finally implementing it, we want to ensure we do it right. With the exception of a few states that allow for 80-miles per mile freeway driving Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming and Texas who allows for speeds of up to 85-miles per hour on the freeway, most states allow a maximum speed of 75-miles per hour. We wanted to make it easy for motorcyclists in most all states to easily obey their respective posted speed limit.”  According to Littleton, motorcyclists in the few states that periodically allow for speeds exceeding 75-miles per hour, governors allowing speeds up to 80-85-miles per hour may eventually be implemented, however in the meantime, police officials in these states have been given direction to avoid citing motorcyclists for such infractions as obstructing the flow of traffic when relevant.  Officials expect all motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures to be in compliance with the new regulation by mid to late January 2017, however may file for a temporary 30, 60, or 90-day extension under select circumstances. According to Littleton, citations and fines will be imposed on both motorcyclists and motorcycle manufactures who fail to remain in compliance with the regulation.  According to Littleton, designated motorcycle mechanic and auto-body shops in each state will be permitted to install the mandatory governors on motorcycles manufactured and sold prior to the implementation of the regulation at a subsidized rate. Littleton did not have details regarding the government subsidized repair readily available, however told reporters that he expects the subsidized cost to be around $35 to the consumer.  Littleton concluded the press conference by informing reporters that the U.S Department of Transportation is currently working diligently to release all relevant information pertaining to the new regulation on the U.D.O.T website.",false

And she witnessed quite the irregularity when they showed up for early voting: Not just her husband, but at least one other voter, were told when they got there that records showed they had already voted.  No, both said, they certainly had not. The response of the election officials? They would place a call, and perhaps they would be able to “clear their votes” so they could actually vote.  What?  TRENDING: Meet the 82-Year-Old Woman Known as 'Mom' Who's Been Caring for the Homeless for 30 Years  If you’re not entirelyc lear what happened here, join the club. I have lots of questions:  Who marked these men as already having voted, when they hadn’t?  What exactly does it mean to “clear your vote” and how is it done? Who has the authority to do it?  Did someone frauduently vote using their names? Is it that easy? If so, how many other fraudulent votes end up getting counted because no one realizes they happened?  How many people never get the chance to vote because election officials don’t know how to solve a problem like this?  If people are wrongly marked down as having voted when they didn’t, could the opposite also happen? That people who do vote never have their votes recorded? Can that happen? Does it?  It seems to me there are only two possibilities here: This is either bureaucratic incompetence, which suggests all kinds of problems with election reliability, or fraud, which suggests all kinds of problems with election security. It has to be at least one of the two, if not both. Am I missing something here?  But don’t worry. The media and the entire Democratic Party assure us there is no such thing as voter fraud and you’re a conspiracy theorist if you think there is.

9aaa3322,"Oregon Legislature introduces more than 1,600 bills before taking a break until Feb. 1","SALEM -- During the three-day organizational session that ended Wednesday, the Oregon House and Senate introduced 1,623 bills and resolutions that run the gamut from the seriously serious to the seemingly silly.  Other bills  of interest  Here are some highlights of legislation introduced this week in Oregon's 2011 Legislature:  House Bill 2250:  Would require the State Parks and Recreation Commission to try for an agreement with Portland Parks and Recreation to acquire Forest Park.  House Bill 2749:  Would create offense of driving while drowsy.  House Bill 2140:  Would require anyone younger than 18 and living in Clackamas, Multnomah or Washington county to complete traffic safety education course before obtaining a provisional driver's license.  Senate Bill 4:  Would require school districts to ensure that physical education or recess time is available each school day for students in kindergarten through eighth grade.  Senate Bill 7:  Would create income tax credit for creation of new employment positions.  Senate Bill 130:  Would add green, yellow and red bicycle signals to list of traffic control devices.  Senate Bill 503:  Would suspend cost-of-living raises, filling of vacant positions and out-of-state travel for state government workers through June 30.  Lawmakers return Feb. 1 to begin the real work of slogging through legislation and plugging a $3.5 billion hole in the next budget. The bills that await them suggest Oregonians will hear much debate about taxes. It also appears that lawmakers are ready to take on public employee compensation and retirement and to consider fairly radical reforms to the state's K-12 public schools and universities.  Some measures introduced this week are repeats -- there are a few bills drafted every session for symbolic or political reasons, but they don't usually get a hearing. Among them this time:  , which would allow Oregonians to pump their own gas and  , which would designate English as the state's official language.  There are also a number of bills aimed at breaking questionable habits. For example,  would make it illegal to carry a child younger than 6 on a bicycle or in a bicycle trailer.  proposes a $90 fine for those who drive with an animal on their lap.  Got your attention? Here's a look at other pending action:  Of border collies and classical music  Every session, there are bills that seem cute and easy, but spark a big fight.  This year's nominee is  , which would designate the border collie as the state dog.  After criticizing a bill last session that named the Dungeness crab the official state crustacean,  R-John Day, admitted he's feeling kind of sheepish about introducing his border collie bill.  A constituent asked him to submit the measure, Ferrioli said, noting that even he thinks the chances are slim.  How, he asked, do you convince the dachshund owners that the border collie should be the state dog?  And then there are measures that appear frivolous, until they're explained.  would require TriMet to broadcast classical music at MAX light-rail stations in high-crime areas.  We shouldn't let the fear of looking silly get in the way of a good idea, said Rep.  a Portland Democrat and the bill's sponsor.  Piped-in classical music has helped reduce robberies, drug calls and vandalism in Florida, London and Tokyo, Smith said.  Here in Oregon, he said, a test last month at the MAX station at 162nd Avenue and Burnside saw crime down 41 percent compared with December 2009.  MAX safety is a big issue in my district, Smith said. We don't have any money for anything and this is, perhaps, the most cost-effective safety idea in the world.  It's your money  Former Gov. Ted Kulongoski urged legislators to change the kicker tax law last year, but they didn't want to go there -- especially with an election coming up. But Sen.  , a Portland Democrat and chair of the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee said the 2011 Legislature must commit to kicker reform.  There are a number of kicker bills. Some propose to divert any income above the state's expected forecasted revenue into a reserve account rather than returning it to taxpayers. Others would keep all or part of the kicker for individual taxpayers but funnel the corporate kicker into state savings.  Lawmakers also may revisit Measure 67, a controversial proposal raising the state's corporate minimum tax. It passed during the 2009 Legislature and was endorsed by voters last January but has continued to leave a sour taste in the business community.  proposes an alternative method of assessing the corporate minimum while  would repeal Measure 67 outright.  Schools: Raising the grade  A number of bills take direct aim at improving public school performance. Among the most dramatic is  , which would prohibit schools from allowing a student to leave third grade if he is not reading at or above a third-grade reading level.  You want to intervene on problems early and get them taken care of rather than shuffling students along, said  , a Wilsonville Republican who was named co-chair of the House Education Committee this week.  Democrats have their own ideas about reform, too.  Twin bills,  and  , designate the governor as the state's superintendent of public instruction as opposed to the separately elected state superintendent of schools.  , a Eugene Democrat and legislation sponsor, says the ultimate responsibility for Oregon's schools ought to rest with the top elected leader.  The idea isn't a new one, he said, but this is the session for making significant changes.  --",partially false
cbb6ee95,The Fight for Wisconsin’s Soul - The New York Times,"Equally troubling was the more recent discovery by Tom Fitz, a geology professor at Northland College in Ashland, Wis., of a highly carcinogenic asbestos-form mineral at one of GTac’s sampling sites. The fibers of the mineral, which would be dispersed in blasting, are like tiny, breathable needles.  Last September, several hundred people gathered outside John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport in Ashland, a few miles from GTac’s mining site, to commemorate Kennedy’s 1963 speech, which called for legislation to protect the area’s natural resources and promoted its economic potential as a scenic region for recreation. One of the last to speak at the event was Mike Wiggins Jr., the chairman of the Bad River tribe and the mine’s most formidable opponent.  The Bad River fear the contamination of the fish they depend on for food and the destruction of sensitive wild rice beds that they harvest on the coast of Lake Superior. Mr. Wiggins has voiced his opposition to the mining legislation in private meetings with Mr. Walker, led Wisconsin’s tribes in demonstrations at the State Capitol in Madison and allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the Bad River tribe’s scant resources to legal fees to fight the mine.  The Bad River and several other tribes assert that the state has no right to permit the enormous mine without their agreement since the site lies in “ceded territory,” an area covering a large portion of Northern Wisconsin where tribal members maintain special hunting, fishing and harvesting rights enshrined in federal treaties. Last June, one of the tribes established an educational camp near the mining site to draw attention to how the mine would violate its treaty rights, as well as to highlight sustainable alternatives to mining. GTac responded to a minor altercation with protesters unconnected to the camp by hiring an Arizona-based private-security firm, which sent guards armed with semiautomatic weapons to patrol the mine site. The guards have since been withdrawn; the camp is still there.  In the Chippewa tradition, a decision is made based on how it will affect people seven generations forward. By contrast, the company’s optimistic estimate for the life span of the first phase of the mine is 35 years. Last summer Mr. Wiggins played Governor Walker a recording of Kennedy’s speech. Mr. Wiggins said that the governor appeared indifferent to Kennedy’s words; Mr. Walker has never wavered in his support of the mine.  Though GTac has already begun bulk sampling iron ore at the site, the mine still faces many hurdles before it can be permitted. The company has filed incomplete sampling applications with the state’s Department of Natural Resources. GTac’s president, Bill Williams, is facing a criminal inquiry in Spain for alleged environmental crimes, which are unrelated to the GTac mine. The charges state that runoff from an open-pit mine where he once worked as an executive contaminated local groundwater. Mr. Williams denies the charges and declined to comment on them. Most important, the tribes will almost certainly challenge the mine in federal court.  Mr. Wiggins and five other tribal leaders have already begun seeking redress from the federal government. Last August, they sent President Obama a letter asking him to direct the Interior Department to prevent the construction of GTac’s mine, citing their claims that the mine would infringe on their treaty rights.  Though the letter did not mention it, five years ago Mr. Obama told nearly 400 Native American tribal leaders, “We have a lot to learn from your nations in order to create the kind of sustainability in our environment that we so desperately need.” The president said that the tribes “deserve to have a voice” and “will not be forgotten as long as I’m in this White House.” Last week, Mr. Wiggins said that although he has gotten preliminary responses from two federal agencies, he is still awaiting an answer from the president.",partially false
28a5ba2e,Number of people in poverty in working families hits record high,"The proportion of people living in poverty who are in a working family has hit a record high, according to a report that shows rising levels of employment have failed to translate into higher living standards.  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said that while paid employment reduces the risk of poverty, about 56% of people living in poverty in 2018 were in a household where at least one person had a job, compared with 39% 20 years ago.  Seven in 10 children in poverty are now in a working family, the charity’s annual UK poverty report found.  Single-parent families have been the worst affected by the trend of wages falling behind living costs, it added. Working single parents accounted for three in 10 households in poverty in 2018, compared with two in 10 in 2011.  The JRF’s executive director, Claire Ainsley, said the charity’s latest barometer of poverty in the UK revealed the scale of the task facing Boris Johnson’s administration if it is to “level up” incomes across the UK by narrowing the gap between the wealthiest cities and poorer regions.  “The new government has a historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s,” she said. “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel, and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.”  Amid concerns that the poorest receive worse healthcare and have the most insecure jobs, Ainsley said it was an indictment of recent government policy that the number of people in poverty across the whole workforce jumped from 9.9% in 1998 to 12.7% in 2018.  Labour accused the government of allowing too many people to remain trapped in low-paid insecure work and “all too often the social security system fails to give people the support they need”.  Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said: “The government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs. Zero-hour contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  Approximately 14 million people are in poverty in the UK – more than one in five of the population, including 4 million children and 2 million pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  A family is classified as being in poverty if it has an income of less than 60% of the median income for their family type, after housing costs. A family’s income includes earnings from employment, self-employment, state benefits and inheritances.  The report said people were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  The worst-hit regions were London, the north of England, the Midlands and Wales, while the lowest poverty rates were found in the south of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the JRF said.  The charity was especially concerned about the rise in young people living with their parents, who in a previous era would have started to buy a house and start a family of their own, which it named “concealed households”.  Twenty years ago, 20% 2.4 million of 20- to 34-year-olds lived with a parent or guardian. That proportion rose to 30% in 2018, affecting 3.9 million people, the JRF found.  The report describes in-work poverty as a “critical issue for our economy” and calls for action to reduce job insecurity, lower housing costs and increase earnings for low-paid workers.  The JRF said the introduction of universal credit, which rolls six benefits into one, did not help many low-income families because it required upfront payments for childcare before households were able to access state support.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: “Tackling poverty will always be a priority for this government. We know that getting into work is the best route out of poverty – and there are more people in work than ever before. Wages are outstripping inflation and absolute poverty is lower than in 2010.  “We know that some need more help, which is why we spend over £95bn a year on working-age benefits. Millions will see their benefit payments rise further from April and we’re also boosting the incomes of pensioners each year through the triple lock.”",false
28d5b473,Trump Signs Executive Order Making Flag Burning a Hate Crime,"Burning the flag of the USA is protected free speech. It’s legal. The issue has been heard by the Supreme Court of the United States and has been settled. That’s it. We have to accept it, no matter how distasteful.  President Trump has also made his peace with this even though he hates it with every fiber of his being. But Trump is a thinker. He’s shrewd and he fights for what’s right by taking the winded road if a straight line is not available. And he’s come through again with yet another piece of brilliant, innovative thinking. This is why we elected him.  President Trump has now signed Executive Order Number 3275 and put its contents into law. It states:  “The destruction or desecration of the flag of the United States of America, in any way shape or form, whether through burning, cutting, shredding, or any other means the court may deem fitting, will hereafter be classified as a hate crime, punishable under the American Hate Crimes statute, with identical sentencing guidelines.”  Criminal behavior charged as a hate crime carries a much stricter punishment than those without the classification. Flag burners may now face up to 50 years in prison upon conviction.  This Presidential Order is an effective workaround of the Supreme Court’s decision regarding free speech. While Trump was not able to reject the court’s previous ruling, he was legally able to make this new designation. Haters of this country beware. Your time is up.",false

You are America!”  Specifically, on March 9, Hannity took to the airwaves to dismiss the entire thing and ignore the failure of the Trump administration, obviously intending to calm the masses, no matter how inaccurate the reporting.

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Yesterday social media was awash with Father's Day messages and tributes which were everything from funny to emotional and poignant.  Cards and gifts will have been exchanged as dads all over the UK enjoyed family time.  But this isn't the full picture. New research commissioned by Fathers 4 Justice actually goes some way to shattering the Hallmark image of Father's Day .  The ComRes survey showed that out of more than 1000 fathers, 37 per cent said they, or someone they know, have experienced not seeing their children on Father’s Day.  When applied to the general population of the UK, that number equates to 2.3 million dads.  Image: Getty  The focus of the survey was on men with children aged 18 and under.  It showed the sometimes distressing realities of modern-day fatherhood, as one in five fathers, 20 per cent feared losing, or had lost contact with their children, and 22 per cent knew someone who had experienced this.  One third 32 per cent had experienced, or knew someone who had experienced, distress or mental health issues after being denied access to their children.  Image: Getty  Matt O'Connor, the founder of Fathers 4 Justice told the Telegraph: These figures, lay bare the appalling scale and reality of the challenges dads face on a daily basis. Denial of access to their children, estrangement and mental health problems for millions of men has become the norm.  The campaign also seeks to have a dedicated political representative for men and boys, mirroring the role of Women's minister.  Furthermore, the campaign is pushing for a fully funded 'safety net', which would tackle the alarmingly high rates of male suicide, depression and other health issues linked to family breakdown.  Image: PA  The ComRes poll found that nearly one in six dads, 17 per cent had experienced challenges accessing their children, while a quarter 27 per cent knew someone who had.  Since we started our campaign in 2001, our helpline has received in the order of 750,000 calls, roughly one every 15 minutes, from men, or their partners who are struggling with access after separation, depression and mental health problems, or who are being unfairly treated by a system that seems rigged against them, said Mr O’Connor.  These fathers just want to be able to see their kids and not have to go through a lengthy and expensive legal process to make this happen.

90feecf1,The shocking reason why Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C ... because it contains experimental nanotech components that have NEVER been used in vaccines before,"The shocking reason why Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C ... because it contains experimental nanotech components that have NEVER been used in vaccines before  Lipid nanoparticles cause hyperinflammatory responses in the body, leading to severe reactions, hospitalization and potentially DEATH  UK government prepared for a vaccine death wave  Coronavirus vaccine deaths will be categorized as covid-19 deaths to keep the scam going  You're seeing the reports all over the news: Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C -94F, which is much colder than the North Pole. If it's not stored at this temperature, its ingredients begin to break down and it fails to work. Currently Pfizer is claiming, without evidence, that its vaccine is 90% effective. But this claim is little more than corporate propaganda designed to drive up stock prices through false projections. But why do these vaccines need to be kept at -70C in the first place? The answer, it turns out, is because. As Children's Health Defense explained in an August 6th article , mRNA vaccines undergoing Covid-19 clinical trials, including the Moderna vaccine, rely on a nanoparticle-based “carrier system” containing a synthetic chemical called polyethylene glycol PEG. CHD goes on to explain: The use of PEG in drugs and vaccines is increasingly controversial due to the well-documented incidence of adverse PEG-related immune reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. Roughly seven in ten Americans may already be sensitized to PEG, which may result in reduced efficacy of the vaccine and an increase in adverse side effects. If a PEG-containing mRNA vaccine for Covid-19 gains FDA approval, the uptick in exposure to PEG will be unprecedented—and potentially disastrous. Moderna documents and publications indicate that the company is well aware of safety risks associated with PEG and other aspects of its mRNA technology but is more concerned with its bottom line. Learn more about the super cold temperature requirements for the coronavirus vaccine in my Daily News Brief for Nov. 18th, 2020:Get more Daily News Briefs at the Health Ranger channel on Brighteon.com Why are LNPs Lipid Nanoparticles used in these vaccines? As CHD further explains: LNPs “encapsulate the mRNA constructs to protect them from degradation and promote cellular uptake” and, additionally, rev up the immune system a property that vaccine scientists tamely describe as LNPs’ “inherent adjuvant properties” In other words, the LNPs are, meaning they are designed to cause hyperinflammatory responses in human beings, once injected. This is done in an effort to induce the creation of antibodies that then allow the vaccine manufacturer to claim high effectiveness rates, even when those very same adjuvants cause severe adverse reactions. According to recent vaccine trials conducted by Moderna, 100% of human subjects in the high-dose vaccine trial group experienced adverse reactions.The adverse reactions caused by mRNA coronavirus vaccines are so widespread that the UK government recently admitted it is expecting a massive wave of coronavirus vaccine adverse reactions / side effects. As described in my previous article,  VACCINE DEATH WAVE: UK government posts bid for AI system to process the expected flood of COVID-19 vaccine injuries and side effects described as a 'direct threat to patient life' : The UK government has posted a bid and an award contract notice, seeking an Artificial Intelligence AI system that can process the expected flood of covid-19 vaccine injuries and side effects.

And we will have achieved George Orwell's authoritarian medical nightmare where the treatment keeps the pandemic going in perpetuity, all while the entire scamdemic is used to crush human freedom and enslave people in their own homes and apartments, all around the world. This is what happens when you let Big Pharma collude with the deep state to crush human freedom and work toward their ultimately goal of.

Joe Biden: “It’s estimated that 200 million people will die, probably by the time I finish this talk.”  “It’s estimated that 200 million people will die, probably by the time I finish this talk,” said Biden.  Former Vice President Joe Biden continued to baffle millions of Americans Sunday when discussing the Coronavirus pandemic in the country; falsely asserting “200 million people” have died in the USA from CoVID-19.  AXELROD ON BIDEN: ‘He Either Can Cut It, Or He Can’t’  posted by Hannity Staff - 8.15.19  Democratic strategist David Axelrod weighed-in Thursday on Joe Biden’s potentially reduced campaign schedule; saying “this is bad advice” and claiming the former Vice President can “either cut it or he can’t.”  “This is bad advice. You can’t cloister the candidate and win. He either can cut it or he can’t, and the only way he can prove he can is to be an active and vigorous candidate. He’s running for president of the United States, for God’s sake!” posted Axelrod on social media.  This is bad advice. You can’t cloister the candidate and win.

If he’s held back in any way, that’s almost the antithesis of who he is.”  “I think it’s the wrong approach,” they added.  “Joe Biden has spoken his mind his entire life, which voters know and love about him,” said Biden’s deputy campaign manager. “He’s a real person, he’s authentic, and that will never change.

8a4136a2,Alabama Supreme Court Recognizes Unborn as Persons in Landmark Ruling,"MONTGOMERY, Ala., Jan. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that a chemical endangerment statute must protect children who have not been born yet. The strongly worded ruling is the most important affirmation of the personhood of the pre-born child since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.  The case was appealed to the AL Supreme Court by Amanda Kimbrough, a mother who admits that she smoked meth three days before her baby was born at 25 weeks. Tragically, baby Timmy lived for only a few minutes. The autopsy showed that the baby died from methamphetamine exposure.  The Alabama Supreme Court has dealt a massive blow to the constitutional fraud of Roe v. Wade by recognizing that the preborn child is a person, explained Personhood USA Legal Analyst Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D. This is yet another confirmation that the fight for personhood is targeting the Achilles' heel of the abortion industry and Roe v. Wade.  Kimbrough's attorney had previously debated Personhood Alabama founding member Attorney Ben DuPre on CNN. Kimbrough's attorney claimed in the interview that their case hinged upon the fact that the law regarding methamphetamine exposure to children did not apply to unborn children, only to born children.  The New York Times covered Kimbrough's case in in April, when she was found guilty of a Class A felony. The article quoted assistant district attorney Angela Hulsey as stating, She caused the death of another person, a person that will never have the chance to go to school, go to the prom, get married, have children of their own. You're dealing with the most innocent of victims.  The Alabama Supreme Court agreed with Hulsey, stating in their ruling that, The decision of this Court today is in keeping with the widespread legal recognition that unborn children are persons with rights that should be protected by law.  The Alabama Supreme Court ruling is a monumental victory for the personhood rights of preborn children, affirmed Personhood Alabama member Dan Becker. Personhood Alabama is committed to continuing our fight for the rights of every baby in Alabama.  Personhood Alabama is a chapter of Personhood USA, an organization established to seek protection for the personhood rights of every human being, born and unborn..

8772d0d9,Henry Kissinger Says the Solution to Coronavirus is the New World Order,"Henry Kissinger, eminence grise of imperial US foreign policy, has warned in an op-ed that no government – even his beloved hegemon – can defeat Covid-19 alone, implying that the New World Order he’s always preached must follow.  If the US doesn’t couple its efforts to rebuild its own economy with the first steps toward creating a global government, humanity is doomed, Kissinger wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed.  “No country, not even the US, can in a purely national effort overcome the virus,” Kissinger warned. “Addressing the necessities of the moment must ultimately be coupled with a global collaborative vision and program.”  If we cannot do both in tandem, we will face the worst of each.  Kissinger laments that the pandemic has led to the return of a “walled city” model of nationalist governance, suggesting that “exploration at the frontiers of science” alone can save humanity from disease in his vision of a globalist utopia.  But developing cures takes time, and the notion that countries should be discouraged from protecting themselves in the interim is suicidal. If anything, one of the reasons Italy, Spain, and France were hit so hard by coronavirus was the EU’s dysfunctional insistence on open borders amid the pandemic.  “Global trade and movement of people” are all well and good, but the pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of the globalist system like never before. It will take years for nations to rebuild, and repeating their mistakes is not something they can afford to do.  While serving as Secretary of State and National Security Adviser under presidents Nixon and Ford, Kissinger played a starring role in bombing campaigns against Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos and oversaw regime-change operations that placed brutal dictators in power in Argentina and Chile, as well as supporting state-sanctioned repression in Indonesia.  A notorious report he penned for the Ford administration called for dramatic reductions in population growth across developing nations. One might think, given his record, that he’d be on the side of the virus.  But the Nobel Peace Prize recipient is here presenting himself as an experienced statesman who deeply cares about the future of humanity, calling on the US to “draw lessons from the development of the Marshall Plan and the Manhattan Project.”  Sure, revisiting the Marshall Plan makes sense – there are no doubt insights to be gained from revisiting the rebuilding of Europe’s shattered post-war economies, especially since some of the countries hit hardest by the epidemic are in Europe.  But the Manhattan Project? How does a top-secret, international doomsday project that produced weapons with unparalleled killing potential have any bearing on the coronavirus crisis?  Listening to Kissinger, it must be said, is what got the US into its current situation – believing itself exceptional, distrusting all world powers who do not swear abject fealty to it, repeating the same failed policies to the point of parody.  A looming presence in the George W. Bush administration, Kissinger advised the country to plunge headfirst into the ever-expanding War on Terror, penning an editorial in the days following 9/11 that called for taking on “any government that shelters groups capable of this kind of attack.”  Following such guidance has bankrupted the US and turned it into a banana republic, printing money frantically while its roads and bridges crumble, its citizens struggle to keep a roof over their heads, and the international community looks on, mouths agape, as its government continues to lecture them about human rights.  Kissinger concludes his jeremiad with a warning that “failure [to safeguard the principles of the liberal world order] could set the world on fire.”  If, as he himself writes, the “purpose of the legitimate state is to provide for the fundamental needs of the people: security, order, economic well-being, and justice,” those principles collapsed long ago.  The US’ first step, post-pandemic, should be to put out the fires set by Kissinger and those like him who seek to cloak empire in the rhetoric of liberal democracy.

3e8383dd,“Very Promising:” USC Researchers Discover How to Regenerate Your Entire Immune System in 72 Hours,"The immune system is something that is highly misunderstood not just by everyday people but also by the many conventional doctors who we depend on for health advice.  Most people resort to things like synthetic vitamins and medicines ignoring better natural alternatives to deal with colds and improve immunity, but the cycle of sickness always seems to continue.  For people with compromised immune systems, there are many natural options, and now researchers have discovered what could well be one of the best ways to reset and recharge your immune system; one that happens to be free and is believed to work even in the elderly as well.  White blood cells right help immune response, and they can be recycled through fasting, the study showed.  Three Days to a Whole New Immune System  According to researchers at the University of Southern California, the act of fasting for as little as three days can regenerate the entire immune system, even in elderly people.  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells, which help to fight off infection.  They added that the discovery could be especially effective for people suffering from damaged immune systems, including chemotherapy patients, who were protected from the toxic impacts of the treatment during the fasting period.  Flipping a “Regenerative Switch”  The researchers said that fasting helps the body’s stem cells to begin producing new white blood cells which help to fight off infection in the body.  “Fasting gives the ‘OK’ for stem cells to go ahead and begin proliferating and rebuild the entire system,” Prof. Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology and the Biological Sciences at the University of Southern California, told the UK’s The Telegraph.  He added that the body actually removed parts that were damaged, old or inefficient during the fasting process, creating “literally, a new immune system.”  According to Dr. Longo a person’s system recycles unneeded immune cells, especially damaged ones, in order to create energy while they are fasting.  Over the course of his study’s trials, participants were asked to regularly fast between 2-4 days over a 6 month period.  The study was released in June and Dr. Longo said that clinical trials must still be completed, but added that the research looks “very promising.”  sources: telegraph, althealthworks, cell, medicalnewstoday, nationalpost, usc",other
23bff2ff,Italy Arrests Cardinals And Seizes Vatican City,"Rome, Italy – Italian law enforcement arrested scores of Cardinals early yesterday morning. The Italian military shortly afterward swept into Vatican City. The Italian parliament voted overwhelmingly to merge Vatican City into the city of Rome, effectively ending Catholicism’s reign over the city-state.  To Catch A Predators  Italian law enforcement worked for months to launch a sting program on the pedophile clergy that made up Vatican City. The operation was codenamed Spotlight after the 2015 movie about the clergy sex abuse scandal in Boston, Massachusetts.  Inspector Anthony Canard is the commanding officer of Spotlight. “Everyone knew Vatican City was the center of an international pedophile ring,” he stated. “We sent busloads of orphans into Vatican City for the annual Cardinal Convention. Long story short? The kids were never in harm’s way, and we nabbed a lot of perps.”  At that point, Vatican City was still an independent country. Italian police had to smuggle the cardinals out on the bus to face criminal charges in Italian courts.  Catholic clergy overseas are quick to point out their peers who are under arrest are victims of a virulent strain of anti-Catholicism and hatred of the man-boy sacrament.  Invasion!  Once Spotlight ended and the pedophile ring jailed, the Italian government moved quickly. Local units of the military swept into Vatican City. “We were sick and tired of looking the other way,” an anonymous politician noted.  Swiss Guards were caught unaware. It was obvious their pointy pikes were no match for assault rifles. The invasion was bloodless. No one was injured.  At this time, the Italian government isn’t sure what it’s going to do with all the wealth the papacy built up over the centuries. Insiders say many buildings will be transformed into museums. Other assets will probably be auctioned off and given to survivors of clergy abuse. “It’s poetic justice,” one government official remarked, “and the pedophile priests just got slammed with poetry.”  In related news, a 13-year-old boy gave up masturbating because Jesus wanted him to.

ed102064,"Obama : ‘Legally, An Impeached President Can’t Appoint Judges’","In his legal standing, former President Barack Obama is more or less the foremost Constitutional law authority in the United States. This weekend, he may have brought up a devastating wrinkle to President Trump’s outgoing plans for the Supreme Court as well as all of the lower jurisdictions.  According to an interview with Joe Barron of the Washington periodical Impeached Embarrassments Monthly, Trump lost his constitutional permission to assign or appoint any person to any legislative body of any kind after he was permanently and forever impeached in the course of his first and soon to be only term in office. Obama made the statement clear by citing code within the Constitution referring to the penalties of being a failed and disgraced commander in chief.  “Ah, if you folks look up Article eleven, section five, you’ll see very clearly where it denies any person elected to the Presidency and then consequently legally impeached by the Congress, all power of appointment that may ‘take responsibility for decisions in a manner that reflect the shame and disgrace of a leader who was shamed with the criminal reflection of his station.’ In other words, ah, it’s similar to denying a convicted prisoner the right to vote. It’s a legally-valid label of untrustworthiness. I mean, come on, you wouldn’t let someone who caused a dozen traffic pileups to drive a car the next day, right?”  Both Obama and his incredibly popular and successful wife Michelle are lawyers, despite many semi-mutated followers of Donald Trump believing they are unable to practice. Although, to be fair, these are mostly the same people who fervently believe that little people live inside their radios and sing thanks to witchcraft.  While it is permissible, barely, for the, again, permanently impeached President to travel from the White House to any destination within ten miles on his own, it is usually frowned upon due to Trump’s grain silo-like shape and weight. Sometimes you just have to play the impeached cards that you’re impeachedly dealt.",false
f8b8c9a0,Official site of Governor Tony Evers,"Content_Area1  A Letter from Governor Tony Evers    I've been an educator my entire adult life.    Some of the most meaningful moments in my life happened in the classroom. I met my wife, Kathy, in Mrs. Potter's kindergarten class in my hometown of Plymouth, Wisconsin. My first job was teaching science in Baraboo. Before becoming state superintendent, I was a high school principal in Tomah, and I ran school districts in Oakfield and Verona. As state superintendent, I worked to ensure every child in Wisconsin can get a world class education by creating a public school system that is fair for all.    I'm not only an educator – I'm also a parent. My three kids attended public schools in communities around the state. No matter where the Evers family ended up, we were welcomed by the community. That culture of acceptance is part of what makes Wisconsin special.    I believe that we are stronger when we look out for each other. I was elected governor and as state superintendent three times by a coalition of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans because I'm honest, I work hard, and I know how to treat folks on the other side of the aisle with respect without sacrificing our Wisconsin values.    I've worked across party lines to get things done for our kids, and now as governor, I am working to build an economy that works for everyone, healthier communities, support for our kids and our schools, and better roads and infrastructure.

c61678bd,Dr. Jill Biden: ‘All Americans Will Be Required to Learn Spanish When We Win’,"Dr. Jill Biden, former English teacher, and wife of Presidential hopeful Joe Biden, appears to be counting her huevos before they hatch.  Her only initiative as First Lady will be to require all Americans to learn Spanish. As everyone knows, there’s only one language that we speak in the United States and that is English.  She claims that the purpose of learning Spanish is to be competitive in the Western Hemisphere’s business and cultural arena. Obviously this is not true.  Jill Biden is seeking to complete the assimilation process to turn the United States into part of Mexico and to give free healthcare and welfare to all illegal immigrants on the backs of American taxpayers.  Biden spokesperson Arturo Tubollos spoke to the press.  “Los Estados Unidos de América es el único país del mundo que tiene ciudadanos que se enorgullecen de saber un solo idioma. El resto del mundo se ríe de este país. Nos llaman estúpidos. Nos llaman ignorantes. Jill Biden hará que Estados Unidos vuelva a ser competitivo. Los estadounidenses sabrán si alguien los está insultando en español. Sabrán responder. ¡También tendremos fútbol en la televisión todo el tiempo! También vamos a dar lecciones gratuitas de cocina mexicana. La mayoría de la comida estadounidense sabe a aguas residuales, por lo que esto también será una mejora para sus vidas. También usaremos solo números arábigos porque podemos.”  Unfortunately, no one was there to translate, but Sr. Tubolls sure seemed excited about something. If he was excited about something in Spanish then we don’t want it in America!  We should follow the example of our current First Lady, Melania Trump. She is fluent in over 6 million forms of communication, though no one has ever actually witnessed her speaking any of those languages because we’re in the United States of America and we don’t do that here.  In America, you speak English or you go back to where you came from. Keep America English only.  Reelect Donald Trump!",false
88522df6,Army Scientists Successfully Teleport Soldiers From Massachusetts to Germany,"According to the Natick Soldier Systems Center NSSC, scientists have managed to successfully teleport a fully equipped squad from Massachusetts to a training area in Germany.  Teleportation is the process of moving objects from one place to another thanks to the transformation of matter into energy and its subsequent reconstruction based on Einstein’s famous formula.  We must take into account that there is no direct relation between teleportation as defined in science-fiction, and quantum teleportation, which is a technical-scientific term used in quantum physics to denote information transport.  The idea of teleportation became famous thanks to the Star Trek 1996 series. In that series, characters moved from their ship to other planets with incredible ease. At the same time, A Mosca was influenced by the tale of George Langelaan and studied the idea and constructed equipment that allowed the teleportation of matter in 1958.

28a4e080,America’s Biggest Owner Of Farmland Is Now Bill Gates,"Corbis via Getty Images  Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world and a self-described nerd who is known for his early programming skills rather than his love of the outdoors, has been quietly snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. — enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.  After years of reports that he was purchasing agricultural land in places like Florida and Washington, The Land Report revealed that Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes, has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states. His largest holdings are in Louisiana 69,071 acres, Arkansas 47,927 acres and Nebraska 20,588 acres. Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.  According to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.  While it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.  It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment. However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.  Gates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick net worth: $7.1 billion ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.  While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states. Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale, landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres, mainly in west Texas.",false

4457e1d4,Border politics: San Diego Democrat Peters says Trump should stop beating up on Mexico,"Border politics: San Diego Democrat Peters says Trump should stop beating up on Mexico  San Diego — As the federal budget showdown begins this week -- amid intense White House pressure for billions of dollars to construct a border wall — California Democratic Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego says that President Trump doesn't get it: that in a thriving urban area that’s home to one of the world’s busiest international crossings with Mexican neighbor Tijuana, “we view the border as an opportunity – not a threat.”  Peters also sharply challenged U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was in San Diego last week to talk up the border wall construction, and who suggested that cities here are “crumbling under the weight of illegal immigration and violent crime.  Peters’ advice to the Trump administration: “Stop beating up on Mexico. They’re friends of ours, the best trading partner. And an extremely important ally…And we’d like someone to hear us,’’ he said. “There’s not a lot of appreciation…for how important Mexican trade is — not just for Texas, and New Mexico and Arizona and California, but the whole country.”  Peters, who represents California’s 52nd Congressional District — which includes San Diego, Coronado and La Jolla — sat down with POLITICO California before Friday’s 2107 Congressional Lunch sponsored by the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. There, 500 business leaders from both Mexico and California convened to hear from a bipartisan panel of House members including Peters, his fellow Democrats Rep. Juan Vargas and Susan Davis, and Republican Reps. Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter.  The San Diego Democrat, first elected in 2012, said that even as the Trump administration has made border issues a lynchpin of its agenda and budget, it has failed to reach out to legislators, like himself, who are at the epicenter of border politics in the region — and who are deeply concerned that White House policies are threatening “millions of dollars in economic activity,’’ and millions of jobs in a region where international cooperation has produced prosperity on both sides.  “It’s really counterproductive to have the Trump administration taking about a wall, a border adjustment tax -- and this attitude about Mexico like they are not our friends. They are good friends to San Diego.”  Some excerpts from the conversation:  POLITICO: Your response to AG Sessions saying cities like San Diego are “crumbling” under the weight of crime from the border?  Peters: “We always crow about San Diego and El Paso being two of the safest cities in America, which is true. In San Diego, we view the border as an opportunity, not as a threat.”  POLITICO: What’s your view of Trump’s border wall proposal -- and his requests for billions to build it?  Peters: “There’s so many better and more cost effective ways to deal with security. What’s the issue with border security? It’s the one percent of cargo that contains stuff you don’t want coming in — whether it’s drugs or guns. And so what you do for that is not build a wall..that can be tunneled under. And can’t really be physically constructed. You hire more customs and border patrol agents -- more blue shirts. Fewer brown shirts. You employ better technology to catch that stuff, and you would save so much money — and get the job done.”  POLITICO: What about the business concerns here on the border?  Peters: “When I was first elected in 2013, I went to Jerry Sanders — the former mayor, who’s head of the Chamber now -- and asked, “What’s the most important thing we can do for the business community in Washington D.C.?” And he said: “The border waits are killing us. They were two hours up to four hours. The funding had stalled for the San Ysidro Border Crossing crossing, which is the busiest land crossing in the world...So frankly, the five of us in the House delegation worked together to get that done. The Democrats worked together, speaking to the President and the Senate at that time..and we got Darrell Issa and Duncan Hunter to get help us put that into the budget. And I think it was one of the biggest expenditures for infrastructure in that two-year cycle, and now it’s on track, almost done. The waits are way down. It was tens of thousands of jobs, and millions of dollars in economic activity from these delays….it means money on both sides of the border.”  POLITICO: What’s about Trump’s view of this issue?  Peters: It’s really counterproductive to have the Trump Administration taking about a wall, a border adjustment tax — and this attitude about Mexico like they are not our friends. They are such good friends of San Diego….The Senate took the right approach in 2013, which was probably more armament than border security than we would want, but that was the compromise Democrats had to make to get permission slips for the workforce, reunited families and people coming out of the shadows and paying taxes. That was a good plan. We couldn’t get a vote on the House floor. But now we’ve taken a step backwards with Jeff Sessions in charge.”  POLITICO: “What about comprehensive immigration reform? Will it happen -- and what’s the cost if it doesn’t?  PETERS: “In 2013, who was for comprehensive immigration reform? The Chamber of Commerce. The AFL-CIO. The tech community. The faith community. The farmworkers — and the farmers. Because everybody knows this is an important part of our workforce. Around here, we have a lot of scientific jobs. I think 60 percent of our scientists are immigrants in California….we want to be the center of this brain-powered economy -- and we are scaring away scientists. People are afraid to go to work because they’re afraid of being rounded up. They’re getting their kids documents prepared in case the parents are shipped off. It’s just awful.  POLITICO: “What other worries are you hearing from constituents here?”  Peters: “Our three drivers here in San Diego are tourism, the military and science and technology...we’re one of the top three biotechnology regions in the country, and in clean energy technology too. We’ve checked in with The Navy; if we don’t pass the 2017 budget, they’re talking here about five ships that won’t be available to sail just out of the Western region — and 15 worldwide...the money for the wall? That’s, by the way, the cost of one and a half aircraft carriers.  POLITICO: With 100 days of the Trump administration this week, the president has been pushing repeal of Obamacare again and says the GOP has a “great” plan to replace. Your response?  Peters: “I think it’s not great. And I think people hate it… We’re going to go back to the model we had before effectively. And going back to losing your house to pay your medical bills is just not where we want to go….“People are terrified. I spoke to University of San Diego medical students, and faculty members who said now the children of some of these undocumented people are citizens, but the parents are too scared to take them to the doctor even if they have cancer. So they wait until they go to the emergency room where they don’t have to have documentation. And it’s too late for the kids...they can die. It’s tragic.”  POLITICO: What’s the chances of the GOP's health care plan passing?  Peters: “We’ve heard nothing from Trump, in a direct way...he’s got nobody working there, and the level of administrative chaos is just astounding, when you think of his work as a business person. But when you think back about his business, it was a family business about which hotels to open, it wasn’t running a multi-faceted operation.  Now, they’re the dog that caught the car. They’re in charge of it all, so in addition to having these ideological divisions within their conference, they have no experience on passing legislation.”    This article tagged under: California  Scott Peters",true

He suggested that we should ban the national anthem before football games since it offends so many people. We are taking his advice because we respect the wishes of people with other beliefs. We will have the national anthem banned. It’s not representative of America.”  Republicans are not having it. They are riled up over this news. Senator Joe Barron issued this statement:  “We will not allow this nonsense to go forward. The national anthem is very relevant to sporting events. It should be said thrice a day in fact. We will be pushing a bill to make it mandatory to be sung at all schools and workplaces in the nation thrice daily. The song represents freedom, so we will require it. It’s mandatory.”  It’s good to see at least some in Congress are looking out for the rights of real Americans. If these Democrats are offended by America, then maybe they should pack their bags. There are many Americans willing to help them pack.",false
312b0fa0,Ohio Senate tables proposed right-to-work bills,"COLUMBUS — Ohio’s latest battle over workers’ rights lasted about 36 hours.  A day after word leaked out that two bills and a proposed constitutional amendment were about to be introduced to make Ohio the 25th “right-to-work” state, Senate President Keith Faber R., Celina shot down the legislation’s chances in his chamber.  “We have an ambitious agenda focused on job creation and economic recovery, and right-to-work legislation is not on that list,” Mr. Faber said. “After discussions with other leaders and my caucus, I don’t believe there is current support for this issue in the General Assembly.  “The only purpose this discussion serves right now is to generate a bunch of breathless fund-raising appeals from the Ohio Democratic Party.”  The bills would prohibit employees who refuse to join a workplace bargaining unit from being forced to pay fees in lieu of union dues. Their backers took issue with comparisons with the contentious fight over Senate Bill 5 that ended in an embarrassing defeat for Republicans in 2011.  “Senate Bill 5 was about collective bargaining and putting sort of guardrails around collective bargaining … ,” Rep. Kristina Roegner R., Hudson said. “This is quite the opposite of that. This is saying, ‘Workers, you have the freedom to join a union, to pay to be represented by them, or not.’ ”  The fight over Senate Bill 5 in 2011 filled the Statehouse and its lawn with protesters and placed Ohio in the national spotlight right up to the point when voters soundly rejected the law at the ballot box that November.  The “fair-share fee” issue was one of numerous provisions that had been tacked onto Senate Bill 5 and ultimately never went into effect.  Tom Enright, a Walbridge construction electrician and treasurer of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 8 in Toledo, was among about 50 protesters chanting “O-H-I-O, right-to-work has got to go!” outside the Statehouse on Wednesday.  “It takes away your rights as a union member. There’s no freedom here,’’ Mr. Enright said. “Right now if someone doesn’t want to pay union dues, they might have that right. They can pay for the services they use from that union.  “All right-to-work says is the union has got to represent you, and you don’t have to pay anything. They’re getting something for free. That’s not right, and it’s not fair to everyone else.”  Gov. John Kasich’s dismal poll numbers immediately after Senate Bill 5’s rebuke at the polls have since recovered, so Democrats have been eager to tie him to what they characterize as a new round of anti-worker legislation going into his 2014 re-election campaign.  In a fund-raising email, Ed FitzGerald, Cuyahoga County executive and the only announced Democratic candidate for governor next year, characterized the lawmakers behind the bills as “Governor Kasich’s Statehouse friends.”  Mr. Kasich has not embraced either proposal and has attempted to distance himself from the issue in general, even as neighboring Michigan and Indiana became right-to-work states and a separate petition effort was launched in Ohio to put the question directly to voters.  Ms. Roegner stressed that the new proposals did not come from the governor’s office. The two bills would have required the governor’s signature to become law. The joint resolution putting the question on the ballot would not.  Both sides cite statistics while supporting their arguments. Opponents claim that right-to-work states have seen wages decline, while supporters argue that new and expanding industries prefer “workplace freedom” states.  In recent years, however, Ohio’s economy has generally recovered at a faster pace than the nation as a whole. Ms. Roegner and co-sponsor Rep. Ron Maag R., Lebanon, however, argued that Ohio would probably have fared better as a workplace freedom state.  “Another thing we need to look at is our neighbor to the north and our neighbor to the west that have now both become right-to-work states,” Mr. Maag said. “Over time, I’m sure, if we look the data, that they will be taking jobs from Ohio.  “We’re doing a great job now, but we’re going to continue to make Ohio the place where workers and employers want to be.”  ",partially false
39d8b03f,Remarks by President Biden on the Administration’s COVID-19 Vaccination Efforts,"State Dining Room  4:22 P.M. EST  THE PRESIDENT: Good afternoon, folks. The Vice President and I have some good news to report, and I’d like to make two key announcements today related to our COVID-19 vaccination effort.  As you know, a few days ago, after a rigorous opening — open and objective scientific review process, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine. We should all be encouraged by this news of a third safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine. The more people who get vaccinated, the faster we’re going to overcome this virus and get back to our loved ones, get our economy back on track, and start to move back to normal.  But that’s — one of my first goals in office was — when I got into office was to say that there will be 100 million vaccination shots administered in my first 100 days in office. We’ve got halfway to that goal in 37 days, and I feel confident we’ll make it all the way.  As I — and as I’ve said, we have a long way to go, but, you know, as I said from the outset, we’re going to use every resource of the federal government to make it happen. Among the things I learned when I came into office was that Johnson & Johnson was behind in manufacturing and production. While we pote- — while we had the potential of another highly effective vaccine to accompany the two existing vaccines, it simply wasn’t coming fast enough. So my team — my team has been hard at work to accelerate that effort.  As I’ve always said, this was a wartime effort, and every action has been on the table, including putting together breakthrough approaches.  And today, we’re announcing a major step forward: Two of the largest healthcare and pharmaceutical companies in the world — that are usually competitors — are working together on the vaccine. Johnson & Johnson and Merck will work together to expand the production of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine. This is the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two.  We also invoked the Defense Production Act to equip two Merck facilities to the standards necessary to safely manufacture the J&J vaccine. And with the urging and assistance of my administration, Johnson & Johnson is also taking additional new actions to safely accelerate vaccine production. Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine manufacturing facilities will now begin to operate 24/7.  In addition, we’ll continue to use the Defense Production Act to expedite critical materials in vaccine production, such as equipment, machinery, and supplies.  I’ve also asked the Department of Defense to provide daily logistical support to strengthen Johnson & Johnson’s efforts. And I want to thank Johnson & Johnson and Merck for stepping up and being good corporate citizens during this national crisis.  Here’s what all this means: We’re now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May.  Let me say that again: When I came into office, the prior administration had contracted for not nearly enough vaccine to cover adults in America. We rectified that. About three weeks ago, we were able to say that we’ll have enough vaccine supply for adults by the end of July.  And I’m pleased to announce today, as a consequence of the stepped-up process that I’ve ordered and just outlined, this country will have enough vaccine supply — I’ll say it again — for every adult in America by the end of May. By the end of May. That’s progress — important progress.  But it’s not enough to have the vaccine supply. We need vaccinators — people to put the shots in people’s arms, millions of Americans’ arms.  To date, we’ve brought back retired doctors and nurses. We’ve developed — we deployed more than 1,500 federal medical personnel you usually see during natural disasters, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency — FEMA — and the Commissioned Health Corps at the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Defense Department, including the National Guard, with thousands of more to come.  We’re also increasing the places where people can get vaccinated. We’ve sent millions of vaccines to over 7,000 pharmacies to make it easier for folks to get their COVID-19 vaccine shot like they would their flu shot.  The federal government is also working with states to set up hundreds of mass vaccination centers in places like stadiums, community centers, parking lots that vaccinate thousands of people per day. My wife Jill and I just visited one in Houston last week. It’s incredible.  And with this increased production of three safe and effective vaccines, we have an opportunity to help address the urgent national need more quickly and getting our schools back open safely.  Right now, an entire generation of young people is on the brink of being set back a year or more in their learning. You can ask millions of parents; they understand. We’re already seeing rising mental health concerns due in part to isolation.  Educational disparities that have always existed grow wider each day that our schools remain closed. And remote learning isn’t the same for every student, as you all know.  Our educators are doing everything they can to protect and educate our students, despite the lack of resources and as districts face budget crises that risk education jobs.  Moms and dads are exiting the workforce in astonishing numbers in order to care for and manage the school experience for their children at home, hindering their own opportunities for — and further undermining the health of our economy.  This is a national imperative that we get our kids back into the classroom safely and as soon as possible. As you know, back in December, I set a goal of having a majority of our K-through-8 schools open by the end of my first 100 days as President.  To achieve that goal, I sent the American Rescue Plan to Congress to provide vital help to make sure schools can open safely — reopen safely. Essential things like more teachers to reduce class sizes, more buses and bus drivers to transport our kids safely, and more space to conduct in-person instructions, and more protective equipment, school cleaning services, physical alterations to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus. All cost money. The House passed the American Rescue Plan last week, and I hope the Senate will follow as quickly and as well.  You know, also, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC, issued new guidelines on how to reopen schools safely. It’s a roadmap that will enable schools — if they have the resources they deserve — to reopen safely. I have given those schools a roadmap. I’ve asked Congress to give them the tools. And today, to add one more tool to school reopening: a vaccinated workforce.  Let me be clear: We can reopen schools if the right steps are taken, even before employees are vaccinated. But time and again, we’ve heard from educators and parents that they have anxieties about that.  So as yet another move to help accelerate the safe reopening of our schools, let’s treat in-person learning like an essential service that it is. And that means getting essential workers who provide that service — educators, school staff, childcare workers — get them vaccinated immediately. They’re essential workers.  Over 30 states have already taken step to prior- –prioritize educators for vaccination. And today, I’m using the full authority of the federal government. I’m directing every state to do the same. My challenge to all states, territories, and the District of Columbia is this: We want every educator, school staff member, childcare worker to receive at least one shot by the end of the month of March.  To help make this happen, starting next week and for a month — the month of March, we will be using our federal pharmacy program to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K through 12 educators and staff and child-care workers. Throughout March, they will be able to prioritize the vaccination of pre-K-through-12 educators and staff and childcare workers. Throughout March, they will be able to sign up for an appointment at a pharmacy near them.  And I want to be very clear: Not every educator will be able to get their appointment in the first week, but our goarl [sic] — goal is to do everything we can to help every educator receive a shot this month, the month of March.  I want to conclude with this: We’re making progress from the mess we inherited. We’re moving in the right direction. And today’s announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic. But I have to be honest with you: This fight is far from over. I told you I’d be straight up with you from the beginning. As I said many times, things may get worse again as new variants spread and as we face setbacks, like recent winter storms in the Midwest and South. But our administration will never take this public health threat lightly.  Though we celebrate the news of the third vaccine, I urge all Americans: Please keep washing your hands, stay socially distanced, wear masks — keep wearing them, get vaccinated when it’s your turn. Now is not the time to let up. I’ve asked the country to wear masks for my first 100 days in office. Now is not the time to let our guard down. People’s lives are at stake.  We have already — we have already — and I carry this in my pocket — lost more — as of today, we’ve lost more than 511,839 Americans, as of today. It’s got to stop.  We need the United States Senate to follow the House and pass the American Rescue Plan, because despite the optimism, without new resources, our entire effort will be set back. We need the resources in the American Rescue Plan and we need it urgently. We need them expanding testing, ramp up vaccine distribution, fund FEMA and other federal vaccine efforts, and continue reimbursing states for their efforts.  We need the resources to expand genomic sequencing; to stay ahead of emerging variants; find the protective gear, transportation, staffing, and other costs required for school and business to open safely. We need to fund it. The bottom line is: We need the American Rescue Plan now. Now.  There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can’t assume that. We must remain vigilant, act fast and aggressively, and look out for one another. That’s how we’re going to get ahead of this virus, get our economy going again, and get back to our loved ones.  So thank you. And please, please, it’s not over yet. Great news, but stay vigilant. May God bless you, and may God protect our troops. Thank you all very, very much.  Q Mr. President, based on the news you announced, when do you think things will get back to normal? When do you think things will get back to normal?  THE PRESIDENT: When do I think things will get back to normal? I’ve been cautioned not to give an answer to that because we don’t know for sure. But my hope is, by this time next year, we’re going to be back to normal, and before that — my hope. But again, it depends upon if people continue — continue to be smart and understand that we still can have significant losses. There’s a lot we have to do yet. So thank you.  Q Did you receive a briefing about the border today?  THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I did.  Q What did you learn?  THE PRESIDENT: A lot.  Q Is there a crisis at the border, sir?  THE PRESIDENT: No, we’ll be able to handle it, God willing.  4:34 P.M. EST",partially false

Oregon is entirely vote-by-mail, and ballots were sent out in the last week of April, and due this Tuesday at 8:00 PM. Many were shocked to open their ballot to find that they were no longer with the party they thought they were with, and they received non partisan ballots. As Oregon is a closed primary state, this effectively denies these people the right to vote in the party’s primary that they thought they were registered as.  This is only reportedly happening to folks who were registered as Republican.  Read the full story from The Gateway Pundit  Want more BFT?

62897eb4,"VATICAN BLACKOUT: Pope arrested on 80 count indictment for Child Trafficking, Fraud – Conservative Beaver","UPDATE: It appears that Pope Francis tweeted out this morning, however Conservative Beaver has confirmed Pope Francis has a social media team that schedules his posts, and this one was pre-planned. If you click on the tweet, you can see TweetDeck was used to schedule the post.  Pope Francis is still in Federal Custody in Italy, hence, he has not been seen on video. The FBI are enroute for the interrogation, according to sources.  I read 10 minutes ago there's a blackout in the Vatican and you were arrested. — Shoe Repair Lady👠🥾 @ShoeRepairLady January 10, 2021  VATICAN / ITALY – Pope Francis aka Jorge Mario Bergoglio was arrested Saturday in connection with an 80- count indictment of charges including possession of child pornography, human trafficking, incest, possession of drug paraphernalia and felony fraud.  What's going on with these blackouts… including the Vatican? — Tim Young @TimRunsHisMouth January 10, 2021  The Italian National Prosecutor’s Office confirmed it ordered the arrests, and filed the charges.  Military officers, Italian police, and their Sex Crimes Unit went to the pope’s home in the Vatican, they arrested him and several other high ranking officials, and placed them all under arrest without incident. People near the scene have reported hearing gunshots, but the Police would not confirm if they were the ones firing the weapons.  Pope Francis is currently being held in an unknown prison, being interrogated by Federal Agents working for the state of Italy and Interpol. The FBI is reportedly making arrangements to fly in and interrogate him once Interpol is done with him.  Giuseppe Governale, Italy’s chief anti-mafia prosecutor, was called in early into the investigation into Pope Francis and others within the Vatican. He said the group was “underestimated” and particularly dangerous because of its ability to proliferate across nations and infiltrate them.  “These individuals are truly the worst of the worst in society. I can promise you, we will not stop targeting human trafficking until we put a stop to this despicable trade in the Vatican and Italy, as well as surrounding countries around Europe. While I am a lead prosecutor in Italy, my department will strive to protect our citizens, especially those that need us most, our children”. Giuseppe Governale  In order to make the arrest, police and military agents had to cut off the power in the Vatican, as well as dim the live cam. This was noticed by web-sleuths, who quickly became suspicious of what was happening in the Vatican.  BREAKING ALERT: Following a nation-wide #blackout in Pakistan, there is now a widespread blackout at the Vatican. pic.twitter.com/4QrRQsIRlt — anoncat🐈",false
32cd89e8,Top Pathologist Claims Coronavirus is “The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated on an Unsuspecting Public”,"Top pathologist Dr. Roger Hodkinson told government officials in Alberta during a zoom conference call that the current coronavirus crisis is “the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public.”  Hodkinson’s comments were made during a discussion involving the Community and Public Services Committee and the clip was subsequently uploaded to YouTube.  Noting that he was also an expert in virology, Hodkinson pointed out that his role as CEO of a biotech company that manufactures COVID tests means, “I might know a little bit about all this.”  “There is utterly unfounded public hysteria driven by the media and politicians, it’s outrageous, this is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public,” said Hodkinson.  The doctor said that nothing could be done to stop the spread of the virus besides protecting older more vulnerable people and that the whole situation represented “politics playing medicine, and that’s a very dangerous game.”  Hodkinson remarked that “social distancing is useless because COVID is spread by aerosols which travel 30 meters or so before landing,” as he called for society to be re-opened immediately to prevent the debilitating damage being caused by lockdowns.  Hodkinson also slammed mandatory mask mandates as completely pointless.  “Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence base for their effectiveness whatsoever,” he said.  “Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue signalling. They’re not even worn effectively most of the time. It’s utterly ridiculous. Seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people – I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense – seeing these people walking around like lemmings obeying without any knowledge base to put the mask on their face.”  The doctor also slammed the unreliability of PCR tests, noting that “positive test results do not, underlined in neon, mean a clinical infection,” and that all testing should stop because the false numbers are “driving public hysteria.”  Hodkinson said that the risk of death in the province of Alberta for people under the age of 65 was “one in three hundred thousand,” and that it was simply “outrageous” to shut down society for what the doctor said “was just another bad flu.”  “I’m absolutely outraged that this has reached this level, it should all stop tomorrow,” concluded Dr. Hodkinson.  Hodkinson’s credentials are beyond question, with the MedMalDoctors website affirming his credibility.  “He received his general medical degrees from Cambridge University in the UK M.A., M.B., B. Chir. where he was a scholar at Corpus Christi College. Following a residency at the University of British Columbia he became a Royal College certified general pathologist FRCPC and also a Fellow of the College of American Pathologists FCAP.”  “He is in good Standing with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, and has been recognized by the Court of Queen’s Bench in Alberta as an expert in pathology.”  In case the above video gets deleted by YouTube, a backup via Bitchute is available here.

80109510,Computer Shop Owner Who Raised Alarm About Hunter Biden Laptop Found Dead,"Hunter Biden certainly has had more than his fair share of strokes of luck lately.  First, despite all of the evidence found on his laptop, nothing has stuck to him.  Next, after John Isaac, the owner of the computer repair shop where Hunter Biden left his laptop gave it to Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Giuliani, in turn, provided it to the FBI as evidence.  Unfortunately, the FBI managed to lose the laptop under mysterious circumstances, and thus all of the evidence contained on it.  Finally, last week, after being harassed and bullied at his home in Delaware by associates ostensibly tied to the Bidens and the ever-present deep state, Mr. Isaac closed up his shop and moved to Colorado, where he opened up a new computer repair shop in hopes of returning his life back to normal.  And now, John Isaac has been found dead, also under highly mysterious circumstances.  Early Wednesday morning a loud explosion was heard throughout South Park, CO, waking up residents from their sleep. When police and fire arrived at the scene, they were confronted by a blazing inferno that had entirely engulfed Mr. Isaac’s new computer repair shop.  A forensic examination found that the cause of the explosion was a laptop that had been dropped off by a local high school student, Eric Cartman. Young Mr. Cartman had ostensibly brought in his laptop because he had inadvertently viewed German poop porn on it in which his mother Liane, who is regarded as a local slut by many South Park residents, played a starring role.  The event had so traumatized the young man that he wanted his hard drive wiped.  In a bizarre coincidence, this is the very same Eric Cartman that was a first-hand witness to the murder of Clinton Foundation investigator Kenneth McCormick, which is currently under investigation by the FBI.  Exactly how the explosives found their way onto Eric Cartman’s laptop is a mystery, although Eric’s Neighbor Kyle Broflovski was able to offer some insights:  “OMG! They didn’t kill Kenny? Those bastards blew up Eric’s laptop! How are we going to watch porn now? Eric was the only one of us with a laptop and access to the internet. I bet it was those Clinton Foundation people, the same ones that killed Kenny the last time.”  This is not the first time, nor is it likely to be the last, that those who dare to investigate the Biden/Clinton/Obama crime syndicate will pay with their lives.",false
98c73066,Robert F. Kennedy Jr: The Government Is Covering Up Vaccine Deaths,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is continuing his personal crusade against Big Pharma and Big Government collusion, authoring a hard-hitting article explaining that the government are withholding information from the public about vaccines – and covering up vaccine deaths – in order to protect pharmaceutical companies.  RFK Jr. writes:  Vaccine scientists and the public health community cautiously and occasionally will admit that vaccines can cause adverse reactions just like “any other medication or biological product.” Although experts are less willing to openly disclose the fact that adverse reactions can and do include death, one has only to look at reports to the U.S. Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS to see that mortality is a possible outcome.  From 1990 through 2010, for example, VAERS received 1,881 reports of infant deaths following vaccination, representing 4.8% of the adverse events reported for infants over the 20-year period.  Moreover, analysts acknowledge that VAERS, as a passive surveillance system, is subject to substantial underreporting. A federal government report from 2010 affirms that VAERS captures only about 1% of vaccine adverse reports.  On the international frontier, the public health community—with the World Health Organization WHO in the vanguard—previously used a six-category framework to investigate and categorize serious adverse events following immunization AEFI, including death.  Guided by this tool, public health teams examined temporal criteria and possible alternative explanations to determine whether the relationship of an AEFI to vaccine administration was “very likely/certain,” “probable,” “possible,” “unlikely,” “unrelated,” or “unclassifiable.”  [Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Drops Vaccine Truth Bomb Live On TV]  In 2013, the WHO’s Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety discarded the prior tool, ostensibly because users “sometimes [found it] difficult to differentiate between ‘probable,’ ‘possible,’ and ‘unlikely’ categories.” The WHO enlisted vaccine experts to develop a “simpler” algorithm that would be more readily “applicable” to vaccines. The resulting four-category system now invites public health teams to classify an AEFI as either “consistent,” “inconsistent,” or “indeterminate” with a vaccine-related causal association or as “unclassifiable.”  Despite the patina of logic suggested by the use of an algorithm, “the final outcome of the case investigation depends on the personal judgment of the assessor” [emphasis added], especially according to the tool’s proponents when the process “yields answers that are both consistent and inconsistent with a causal association to immunization.”  In a 2017 letter in the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, Drs. Jacob Puliyel an India-based pediatrician and member of India’s National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization and Anant Phadke an executive member of the All India Drug Action Network raise important questions about the revised tool.  They describe an Orwellian Catch-22 situation wherein it is nearly impossible to categorize post-vaccine deaths as vaccine-related. This is because the revised algorithm does not allow users to classify an AEFI as “consistent with causal association with vaccine” unless there is evidence showing that the vaccine caused a statistically significant increase in deaths during Phase III clinical trials.  By definition, however, any vaccine not found to “retain safety” in Phase III trials cannot proceed to Phase IV licensure and post-marketing surveillance. The result of the algorithm’s convoluted requirements is that any deaths that occur post-licensure become “coincidental” or “unclassifiable.”  Drs. Puliyel and Phadke describe what happened in India when the country’s National AEFI committee assessed 132 serious AEFI cases reported between 2012 and 2016, including 54 infant deaths that followed administration of a pentavalent all-in-one vaccine intended to protect recipients against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, and Haemophilus influenzae type b infections. For babies who survived hospitalization, the committee classified three-fifths 47/78 of the AEFI as causally related to vaccines with 47% of the incidents viewed as “product-related” and 13% as “error-related”, but they rated nearly all 52/54 of the deaths as either coincidental 54% or unclassifiable 43% despite mounting evidence that pentavalent and hexavalent vaccines are increasing the risk of sudden unexpected death in infants.  …doctors who “naïvely” accept biased reports on vaccine safety “are losing the trust of the public and in the process…endangering public health.”  The absurdity and negligence inherent in the ultimately subjective WHO checklist have not escaped the attention of others in India and beyond. In a series of comments published in the journal Vaccine in response to the 2013 publication of the revised tool, commenters issued the following scathing remarks:  “Even if a healthy child dies within minutes following vaccination and there is no alternate explanation for the AEFI, even then the powers that be could easily declare that death as coincidental and not due to the vaccine, thanks to the new AEFI. This is dangerous ‘science’.”  “Amongst the 20 items of their checklist, no less than 15 75% are devoted to refute a vaccine-induced causality [emphasis in original]…. After all and as the authors confess with an astonishing ingenuousness, the main point is to ‘maintain public confidence in immunization programs.’”  “People understand that there are no true coincidences—only events that have been made to appear to be coincidental by either a genuine lack of understand[ing] of the overall facts leading to the ‘coincidence’ reported or by the deliberate suppression of the facts, including when…AEFIs that result in death are made to ‘disappear.’”  “It seems that huge business in [the] vaccine industry is affecting [the] science of vaccines and we are developing various ways to promote the business at the cost of human lives. …Going for a less sensitive tool for safety concerns is not only illogical but risky for the children of the world.”  Unfortunately, many vaccine proponents appear to be more concerned with forestalling “misconceptions” and “erroneous conclusions about cause and effect” than they are about preventing and identifying adverse events following vaccination. The result, as Dr. Puliyel argues, is that doctors who “naïvely” accept biased reports on vaccine safety “are losing the trust of the public and in the process…endangering public health.”",false
1108fcb4,Closing The Mexico Border Would Affect The U.S. Avocado Supply Greatly,"UPDATE: April 3, 2019, 2:50 PM  Bloomberg reports Hass Avocado prices surged Tuesday as the result of importers stockpiling produce. However, things may get worse. Vice president and senior analyst at Rabobank, Roland Fumasi, told Bloomberg that prices could easily double or triple if we shut down the border.  ORIGINAL STORY: April 1, 2019, 3:40 P.M.  As President Trump continues his threats to close the border, analysts are looking at how that would impact Americans' food supply. In a report published today, Reuters cited recent data from the United States Department of Agriculture that says nearly half of all imported vegetables and 40 percent of imported fruits are grown in Mexico.  While there are other countries that produce the fruits and vegetables we consume, it would take time to adjust trade plans. One of the most imminent problems we'd face would be an avocado shortage, should the border actually close in the next week.  Steve Barnard, the president of Mission Produce, the largest distributor and grower of avocados in the world, told Reuters that because Mexico supplies most of the avocados sold in the U.S. at this time of year, closing the border would mean running out of avocados in as little as three weeks.  California's growing season is just starting, so avocados grown there wouldn't be ready for another month or so. Of note, Barnard told Reuters that California has a very small crop. Depending on how long trade was halted, that could mean fewer avocados in stores and higher prices on the ones that are available.  Other produce that could be in short supply include tomatoes, cucumbers, blackberries, and raspberries, the majority of which all currently come from Mexico.

President Trump appeared at a campaign-style rally last night in Pensacola, Florida to stump for accused sexual predator Roy Moore, who’s running in a special election next week in nearby Alabama to fill the senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  In addition to the de rigueur attacks on Democratic leaders and the “fake news” media that form the backbone of Trump’s rambling speeches at these events, the president added a new twist: victim-shaming the women who have accused Moore of sexually assaulting them, of which there are 9 in total, two of whom were attacked when they were minors.  The crowd, composed largely of Rubio’s fellow Floridians, ate it all up, cheering and howling every time Trump lobbed one of these verbal molotov cocktails. It was this display that moved the normally mild mannered Senator from Miami to lash out on Twitter and throw Republicans from his own state under the bus:  At the sight of the crowds his heart was moved with pity 4 them b/c they were troubled & abandoned like sheep without a shepherd.Matthew9:36 — Marco Rubio @marcorubio December 9, 2017  Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!  There certainly is no love lost between Sen. Rubio and President Trump. The two clashed during the Republican primary, with Trump famously nicknaming Rubio “Little Marco.” Once Trump locked-up the Republican nomination, Rubio withheld his support until the very last minute, and he was quick to criticize the candidate whenever his campaign hit the rocks.  As harsh a critic as he was during the campaign, however, Rubio has been a staunch supporter of President Trump’s agenda in the only way that really matters: with his vote in the senate. These tweets and other critiques are amusing, but they do absolutely nothing to oppose the destruction caused by someone Rubio once called a “dangerous con-man.”  If he really holds this low of an opinion of the president and his base supporters, then it would be nice to see that opposition reflected in his voting record.  Add your name to millions demanding Congress take action on the President’s crimes. IMPEACH TRUMP & PENCE!",false
c17d5523,David Davis: There has long been an alternative to this discredited deal. It’s the Canada-style plan that Tusk and Barnier offered us.,"David Davis: There has long been an alternative to this discredited deal. It’s the Canada-style plan that Tusk and Barnier offered us.  David Davis is MP for Haltemprice and Howden, and is a former Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.  The Spice Girls had it right when they said: ‘stop right now thank you very much’.  Yes, last week was another frenzied one in British politics. The Prime Minister’s proposed agreement with the EU has gone down like a lead balloon. I’m afraid it is a failure of nerve by the establishment. Their antics have led to the resignation of two Brexit Secretaries – myself and now Dominic Raab.  MPs, Party members and the British public are rightly dismayed. The consequence is that now there is speculation about the leadership of the Conservative Party.  This is not the Brexit they voted for. This proposal would keep the UK permanently trapped in EU institutions and under EU domination. This is not taking back control of borders, laws and money, which 17.4 million people voted for. It breaks our commitment to leave the Customs Union in the 2017 Conservative Manifesto. This proposed deal will never get through the Commons.  It really is time to stop right now, and say thank you very much.  So that’s where we are. But this is a time for calm heads. The crucial point is there is still time to save Brexit, still time to take control and still time to offer the British people a brighter future. This is the moment of truth. We can reject the proposed agreement and move on. We still have time because the key date in the calendar is 21st January, 2019. Only then does the Government need to make a statement within five days on what the United Kingdom plans to do, according to the European Union Withdrawal Act of 2018.  So, we can use the time until then productively. We know from past experience that the EU always leaves agreement to the final moment possible at the eleventh hour. Everybody in the UK wants the hope of a better deal – and trust me, we can do this. I spent countless hours negotiating with EU counterparts, and I know the great prize of a Canada-style free trade agreement is still possible. Indeed, it is very much still on. Both Michel Barnier and Donald Tusk have confirmed this.  Justin Trudeau said of his country’s free trade deal that it has created “good, well-paying jobs”, putting “food on the table for families”, helping to “grow and strengthen our communities” and ensuring that each generation is “better off” and has a “higher standard of living, than the one that preceded it.”  The question is how do we get there? It does not have to be like this. What we need now is leadership and the courage and confidence to deliver for the UK. We can deliver an honest and clean Brexit, leaving all the possibilities such as global free trade deals open for bright future. If we need to leave with no deal and negotiate a free trade agreement during the transition period, so be it. Let’s be clear and honest and tell the EU that’s what we are prepared to do.  As we leave the EU, our geography remains fixed. We remain an island maritime nation, outward-facing and trading across the globe. British goods and services are recognised as the best in the world, and are sought after by global customers. This cannot and will not change.  We can go back to the EU and say, if necessary, we are prepared to leave on world trade terms without a deal, but we would rather agree a positive way forward for all sides. We only need to be ready to trade under World Trade Organisation rules: international laws that regulate the trading relationships of 164 member states and around 98 per cent of global trade.  It in all our interests – the UK’s, the EU member states’ and most importantly the British people’s – that we start again and sort this our properly. Let us become, once again, a self-governing, free-trading nation. This is the best approach to unite the Conservative Party and address the huge concerns of MPs, members and activists.  Then we can stop being ‘always on the run’, look beyond Brexit – and provide the ‘human touch’ by focussing on issues like housing, education, health and crime that matter so much in the lives of families up and down our country.",false
8987057d,U.S. STATE GOVERNORS NAMES ON CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY **MEMBERSHIP** LIST,"Nation  U.S. STATE GOVERNORS NAMES ON CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY **MEMBERSHIP** LIST  A database obtained by computer hackers from China Communist Party computers allegedly reveals the names of more than a DOZEN U.S. State Governors who are reportedly shown in the database as being MEMBERS of China's Communist Party:  The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government. Here is a statement from IPAC about the data:  Detailed analysis by U.S. Intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  The list mostly includes the details of CCP members based in Shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. The CCP's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  China Communist Party CCP members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the US, Australia and the UK, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the CCP an edge on the world stage.  Make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and Chairman Xi Jinping.  This is a fascinating look inside the CCP’s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  The original database in Chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from Shanghai, many complete with National ID number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them INSIDE the companies they have infiltrated. Some of the names are listed as having been “executed” while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  Take a quick look at how the CCP works:  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on November 3, where President Trump lost the traditionally Red State, has a brother. Meet Brother, Ron Raffensperger CTO for HUAWEI Enterprise Storage Solutions, the Data Storage Company of . . . . the CCP.  The same Chinese Communist Party CCP that paid DOMINION $400 million through a subsidiary of HSBC, a month or so BEFORE the November 3 election, which may have gotten the CCP the ability to update Dominion voting software for the then-upcoming U.S. Presidential Election!  Elsewhere, other key people are tunring out to have strong connections to the CCP. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – currently obstructing efforts to investigate Michigan’s election results – developed ties with Chinese state-run universities and trained lawyers for the Chinese Communist Party – even delivering a lecture at Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s alma mater.    Benson undertook the work aiding the Chinese Communist Party while serving as the Dean of Wayne Law School in Detroit, Michigan.  Being the CTO for a mega corporation like HUAWEI pays huge bucks. Maybe some of that money is going to a certain Secretary of State? Who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the CCP?  China's infiltration efforts have been vast. Major aerospace companies Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Boeing have employed hundreds of CCP members. Additionally, Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine developer! employed a total of 123 Party members. British automaker Jaguar Land Rover also employed CCP members.  Now, back to the USA. The Governors allegedly named in the database are listed below:    AZ - Ducey    AR - Hutchinson    CA - Newsome    CT - Lamont    NM - Grisham    VT - Scott    IA - Reynolds    RI - Raimondo    NE - Ricketts    DE - Carney    IN - Holcomb    NV - Sisolak    TN - Lee    KY - Beshear    ID - Little    MT - Bullock    OR - Brown    IL - Pritzker    LA - Edwards    TX - Abbott    MN - Waltz    MA- Baker  NC-Cooper    UT - Herbert  Other names totaling 1.9 Million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. The process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: Click image to enlarge  POMPEO WARNED THEM ALL  Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, spoke at the National Governor's Association Winter Meeting and HE WARNED GOVERNORS they were being targeted by China. He told the Governors that China was doing harm to the US and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate Governors into doing things that would help China AT THE EXPENSE of America. Pompeo warned them all to be careful.  The warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it SEEMS that several U.S. State Governors may have already sold-out and become Communists.  COMMUNISM ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES  The Communist Party is unlawful in the United States. It's very existence is banned by federal law. Here is the law:  Of course, while the federal law above bans the Communist Party of the United States, it does NOT ban the Communist Party of China. The question then becomes, have these Governors become members of the China Communist Party CCP for the SAME PURPOSE as that previously espoused by the Communist Party of the United States? Same political ideology . . . same goal?  Folks who live in states whose Governor's name appears on the CCP Member List, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.  If your Governor is a Communist, then your Governor has to go.  Now.  No exceptions.

013da3e3,Biden Accepts Campaign Donation From Antifa,"As the giant hydra-armed machine that is the snarling, lurching Biden campaign lumbers on towards the 2020 election, it has begun to drop all pretense of innocent operation. Holding virtual rallies, releasing a slew of negative ads across the airwaves nationwide, and selling facemasks emblazoned with images of the candidate’s face are just a few of the money-making schemes running for its benefit. But now, Joe Barron, head of the FBI’s Department of Detectivity says they’ve gone too far by accepting a check for thirty-one dollars from the organization called “Antifa.”  The donation, which arrived yesterday at campaign headquarters in Floppyballs, California, was confirmed to have been vetted by interns, and deposited into campaign coffers by Democrat volunteer Calypso Soros, a second cousin of the well-known billionaire. Barron detailed the possible actionable offense:  “Anything from Antifa is blood money, because they have been officially labelled an Anti-American organization by both Trumptards International and Diamond and Silk’s ‘Tents Can Be Clothes’ retail outlet stores. Accepting that money is the same as if you picked up a dollar on the street that a serial killer had dropped two days before. Sure, it seems innocent : but you’re still infected with evil. Biden might as well wear satanic cthulu robes and decapitate a chicken on top of Mother Theresa’s grave for what that thirty one dollars has done to his soul.”  So far, representitives of the Vice President’s campaign haven’t commented on what is sure to become a very serious scandal, but just like his rival Donald Trump, it will bloat and fester until one day it will no doubt explode in some Popeye’s chicken restroom.",other
23e4bd3b,EXCLUSIVE: Clinton Foundation AIDS Program Distributed ‘Watered-Down’ Drugs To Third World Countries,"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative CHAI distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.  The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.  The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.  It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.  Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.  [dcquiz] The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.  “This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.  “When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.  The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.  “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.  The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.  Blackburn said she planned to deliver the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.  The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.  It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.  ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”  “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.  Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.  “These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.  Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.  The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”  Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.  Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.  Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.  Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.  The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”  CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.  Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”  “In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.  The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.  He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.  CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.  CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.  The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.  Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.  The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.  The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.  One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.  Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.  Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.  Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.  “You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

36299bfd,"Biden Quietly Pardons 2,617 BLM Protesters","Joe Biden has shown us all whose side he’ll be on when it comes to law and order.  In a sweeping secret pardon that includes more than 2,616 BLM “protesters,” Biden gave a big eff you to law enforcement.  Biden’s pardon includes “anyone arrested for protesting in a non-violent manner.” Basically, all they have to do is say “I dint do nuffin” and they’re free to go.  According to the White House, there is no pardon, and the issue of BLM protesters has yet to be addressed at all. According to Communications Director, Art Tubolls, the whole thing has been blown out of proportion:  “More like…made up. There is no pardon for anyone because Trump’s federal goons never actually arrested anyone. They just dropped them off in the morning in front of the closaest Circle K with $2 for a large coffee and a blintz.”  Fact-checkers were quick to point out that Circle K doesn’t sell blintzes.  At any rate, the pardons may not be real to some people, but to those of us who believe Joe Biden is the next coming of the antichrist here to unseat Donald Trump and thrust America into the pits of hell, they’re as real as can be, and we won’t stand for it.  A source close to the President said the pardons may not exist, but that Biden was “very proud” to be able to sign them. Whether or not he signed them virtually or just in spirit remains to be seen. One thing is for sure: our streets are a little less safe today with Biden issuing — or not — pardons for nearly 3000 criminals.  It’s gonna be a long four years, America.",false

c614c408,Clinton Foundation Investigator Kenneth McCormick Found Dead,"The Clinton body count continues to grow. Clinton Foundation investigator and prosecutor Kenneth McCormick was found dead today in the driveway of his home in South Park, Colorado under extremely mysterious circumstances.  According to reliable sources in the Department of Justice, Mr. McCormick was in the final phase of his investigation into criminal activity by both Bill and Hillary Clinton and was about to indict the former president and first lady on federal crimes.  According to South Park police, McCormick was found by his next-door neighbors, Stan Marsh and Eric Cartman, laying decapitated in a pool of blood after having apparently committed suicide with a pair of cordless hedge clippers. Munching on a bag of Cheesy Poofs, Eric Cartman lamented the untimely demise of his neighbor and best friend:  “Oh my god! They killed Kenny! Those bastards! Everyone in the neighborhood knew something was up when we started to see those black SUV’s with Clinton Foundation stickers slowly driving up and down our street a few weeks ago. We tried to warn him, but Kenny just wouldn’t listen. He kept mumbling something about Uranium One and that he couldn’t talk about it.”  DOJ spokesman Joe Barron vowed that justice would be served:  “Mark my words: we will find Kenny McCormick’s killer. Attorney General Barr has made this our highest priority. It’s Seth Rich and Vince Foster all over again. This heinous crime will not stand.

Her sister Marisol was upstairs doing that thing she does with a Zagnut and confirmed it to at least 16 girls and one undecided that we know of.”  When asked how credible the source was, we were told “regardless of how credible the source is, the information is true,” which explains everything.

The language, added by Pelosi and Schumer, was very clear of its intention:  “The passing of this legislative package will also outlaw the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in all schools in the United States. This statute will go into effect immediately upon this bill’s passage. Anyone found guilty of reciting the Pledge will be charged with grand heresy, and punished by up to 10 years in a federal penitentiary and a fine of no less than $20,000.”  Republicans Senator Joe Barron slammed the news:  “Democrats bad, Republicans good. It’s really that simple. Everything is simple like that in life.”  The Democrats thought they were sneaky, adding this nonsense into the aid bill. The Republicans were too smart, however, and the foolish Democrat plot was foiled. Republicans are a party of literacy and read they did. They read the bill in its entirety to check for traps like this laid by the Democrats.  It’s also a sad state of affairs that the Democrats would use such a bill, one for emergency relief, to push their leftist communist agenda. Can’t they just stop playing politics for one day and pass a bill for the American people? I guess not. They will never change. They need to be removed and replaced with Republicans that represent the people.",false

However, it was during that time that they realized a compromise could be made.  It was getting arrested that gave us an epiphany. What if, instead of going into the system involuntarily, we could sub in for a POC instead? They could go out, maybe work at our jobs and live in our houses, if they need a place to stay, and show that they are upstanding citizens? Shana Fisher, EBI spokesperson  This no-longer radical idea was presented to the courts by the group’s lawyer, and after several days of deliberation, the judge agreed that it would be doable. It would be a work-release program, except that the prison wouldn’t be losing an individual fit to continue that prisoner’s labor. The group began drafting willing white members of the community to help begin the exchange process.  The first few white people to be exchanged were admitted to the prison, followed by the group and a photographer. As they entered, they saw three black prisoners standing in the processing area with their hands in cuffs. They were shown the three men who would take their places, un-cuffed, and given a satchel which contained their personal affects, some cash, and the addresses to the home of the person they were exchanging with.  All men immediately departed, presumably so elated with their newfound freedom that they forgot to thank the men taking their places, and the white men were placed in cuffs to begin their sentences. They were led away, and all three were smiling and giddy as they disappeared down the hallway.  How can you begin the process to become part of the exchange? First, you’ll need to live in Atlanta. To help combat these limitations, EBI has repurposed an old motel into a half-way house for anyone who doesn’t live in the area so that a local address can be provided. From there, you’ll need to fill out some forms and get on the waiting list to be matched with an available person of color. We’re told that the waiting list is quite long, and could be months out at this point, so you’ll want to sign up soon to get ahead.  As equality is pursued in the United States, groups like EBI are doing everything they can, and more, to help level the playing field and make life better for those who are less privileged.",false
5a68d2d1,"Ghislaine Maxwell has tested positive for COVID-19 in New Hampshire jail, DOJ reports","UPDATE:  TRUE: Fact-check site Snopes rated claim that Ghislaine Maxwell tested positive for COVID-19 in NH jail  A report from the United States Department of Justice indicates that socialite and alleged Jeffrey Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell has tested positive for novel coronavirus COVID-19 in New Hampshire while awaiting extradition to New York.  “Once she was in custody and began to relax, officials noticed that she was displaying symptoms related to coronavirus including watery eyes, cough, and mucus. She stood to be tested regardless of symptoms while in custody, but her symptoms and the profile of this particular case caused local officials to speed up the testing practice,” a release from the US Department of Justice stated.  “It looks really bad,” one New Hampshire official told The Brown Valley Observer. “Her symptoms seem advanced at this point and ultimately she will probably end up requiring a ventilator, more likely sooner than later.”  Maxwell was arrested in New Hampshire Thursday morning in connection with Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking ring. Court papers related to her indictment allege that Maxwell was involved in the sexual abuse and trafficking of girls as young as 14 years old. She has faced allegations and previous charges related to her role as a procurer for Epstein’s alleged “sex island”  Coronavirus testing in jails is currently a standard practice in New Hampshire, with all newly arrested inmates tested before release into general population or otherwise moving or extraditing the inmate.  The DOJ release indicates that officials still intend to extradite Maxwell to New York, where she will take up residence in Manhattan’s Metropolitan Correctional Center. Manhattan MCC made headlines in 2019 when alleged “sex-trafficker to the stars” and pedophile Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in an area of the prison where cameras had reportedly malfunctioned, precluding Epstein from appearing in court and testifying about the sex trafficking ring. The incident sparked dozens of conspiracy theories.  Esptein’s infamous “sex island” has been linked to dozens of Hollywood celebrities and politicians through the years, including president Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton.",false

The videos all took place around the Delporte crater from the Moon where this massive cigar-shaped alien ship can be observed.  The videos were all taken during the Apollo 20 mission which in case you didn’t know by now was a secret mission meant to give NASA the opportunity to collect ancient alien technology from the Moon.  This may seem hard to believe at first if you’re not accustomed to the conspiracy theory, but there is plenty of proof to back it up, including William Rutledge and his incredible story depicting the whole incident.  A whopping 14 photos were also taken from the area, alongside this three-minute video showcasing the cigar-shaped ship emerging from inside of the crater.  William Rutledge also brought up this massive city that was discovered on the Moon in Video 1. He uploaded it on his YouTube channel nicknamed “Retiredafb” and it garnered over 1.5 million views by now before it was deleted by the NSA.  A second video that he uploaded showcases the Alien Girl E.B.E Mona Lisa TV unscheduled transmission which showcases this strange recording of an alien that was meant to be shown on live TV before NASA took a hold of it and hid it from us.

The recount of the presidential election in Wisconsin's two most heavily Democratic counties began Friday with President Donald Trump's campaign seeking to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted. AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh  MADISON, Wis. AP — The recount of the presidential election in Wisconsin’s two most heavily Democratic counties began Friday with President Donald Trump’s campaign seeking to discard tens of thousands of absentee ballots that it alleged should not have been counted.  Trump’s three objections attempting to discard the ballots were denied by the three-member Dane County Board of Canvassers, twice on bipartisan votes. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell said he expected the campaign was building a record before filing a lawsuit.  Joe Biden won Wisconsin by 20,600 votes and carried Dane and Milwaukee counties by a 2-to-1 margin . Trump only paid for recounts in those two counties, not in the 70 others, 58 of which he won.  There’s no precedent for a recount overturning a deficit as large as Trump’s in Wisconsin, so his strategy is widely seen as seeking to build a case to take to court.  His team on Friday sought to have ballots discarded where election clerks filled in missing address information on the certification envelope where the ballot is inserted; any absentee ballot where a voter declared themselves to be “indefinitely confined” under the law; and any absentee ballot where there was not a written application on file, including roughly 69,000 that were cast in-person during the two weeks before Election Day.  Trump attorney Christ Troupis argued that certification envelopes filled out by people who voted absentee in-person do not count under the law as a written application, even though the envelope is identified as such. The board of canvassers, controlled 2-1 by Democrats, voted unanimously to reject the complaint.  Troupis also argued that people claimed to be indefinitely confined even though they were not. Such a declaration exempts the voter from having to show a photo ID to cast their ballot, which Troupis called “an open invitation for fraud and abuse.” The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Supreme Court this spring ruled that it is up to individual voters to determine whether they are indefinitely confined, in line with guidance from the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission.  The canvassing board voted 2-1 to count those ballots, with the Republican opposed.  ADVERTISEMENT  Trump’s attorney also claimed that the law does not allow clerks to fill in missing information on the envelope that goes with absentee ballots. The state elections commission told clerks before the election that they can fill in missing information on the absentee ballot envelopes, a practice that has been in place for at least the past 11 elections.  The canvassing board voted unanimously to count those ballots.  In Milwaukee, the canvassing board agreed to Trump’s request to set aside all absentee ballot envelopes where voters claimed “indefinitely confined” status and those with two different colors of ink, perhaps indicating that someone other than the voter completed the information.  A Trump challenge in Milwaukee to reject and not count absentee ballots in envelops altered by clerk staff to fix addresses or other errors was dismissed by election officials, Biden campaign attorney, Danielle Friedman, said in a call with reporters Friday night.  In limited counting so far, she said the vote tally for Biden has changed little, adding there have been “no changes on the scale that would change the result” and that “the Trump campaign seems aware of that fact.”  “They’re not actually interested in recounting the votes,” she said.  Although the ballots in altered envelopes would be counted, they will still be segregated. It’s a move to keep such ballots separated in case of potential legal challenges in coming days.  Trump also asked to separate absentee ballots with or without written applications and to observe absentee ballot logs that would account for those requested through the state’s myvote.wi.gov website. Unlike in Dane County, Trump’s campaign in Milwaukee initially asked only to review those ballots and others, not to have them discounted.  In both Madison and Milwaukee, the recounts were taking place in large convention centers so workers could be distanced to protect against spreading the coronavirus. Observers were required to wear masks and plexiglass shields were aset up.  Milwaukee County Clerk George Christenson, a Democrat, said it was irresponsible of Trump to force the recount amid the pandemic that is surging in Wisconsin .  “It just shows his lack of empathy toward the American people,” Christenson said.  In Milwaukee, the Rev. Greg Lewis, founding president of groups of faith leaders who sought to bolster Black turnout, said the recount highlights the “oppression, disenfranchisement, downright racism and disrespect” that minority communities in Milwaukee face.  “I almost died and we are running around here counting votes unnecessarily,” said Lewis, who contracted COVID-19 earlier this year. “This is nonsense. This is pitiful. Why do we keep putting up with this? The people have decided, let it be.”  There have been at least 31 recounts in statewide elections in the U.S. since the most famous one in Florida’s presidential election in 2000. The recounts changed the outcome of three races. All three were decided by hundreds of votes, not thousands.  ___  This story has been updated to correct the spelling of the first name of Trump attorney Christ Troupis.  ___  Associated Press writer Michael Tarm contributed to this report from Milwaukee.",false
848b8b3e,Jim Carrey Says ‘Hollywood Elites Eat Whole Babies For Christmas’ -‘The More They Suffer-The Better They Taste’,"Hollywood elites “eat whole babies for Christmas” according to Jim Carrey, who warns “dark forces” are “engaged in a battle for America’s soul“, and the outcome of this battle will have “long-lasting consequences for the entire world.“  “These kids are fattened up for the Christmas table like geese and turkeys, except the animals don’t go through the ritual abuse, the psychological torment that these kids are forced to suffer.“  “These people believe the more the child has suffered, the better it tastes. They believe the negative emotions coursing through the kid’s body, the adrenaline and hatred, will give them special powers. It’s a Hollywood thing influenced by old school Satanism.“  Speaking at a post-screening Q&A for documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond in New York, Carrey said that Christmas and New Year are a time of year he dreads, because of the “dark energy pulsating around Tinsel Town” and his knowledge of “what goes on behind the closed doors of the elite at this time of year.“  “Luciferians in Hollywood turn Christmas into the darkest festival of the year,” Carrey said, before explaining “there is a reason why people around the world feel a heaviness at this time of year.“  “Institutional oppression and Satanism hang in the air while we are all forced to wear smiles and ignore the gut feeling that all is not well.”  “Ever notice how all the homeless children you see throughout the year begin to dissapear at Xmas? You think it’s because they’ve found a home, found shelter, found love and warmth?“  “Christmas time is Satanic slaughter time. They are determined to pervert the most beautiful time of the year into a festival of suffering and blood.”’  Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond charts Jim Carrey’s evolution into cult comedian Andy Kaufman for 1999 film Man on the Moon, a performance which saw Carrey maintain the Kaufman’s oddball identity for the duration of the shoot. However in New York on Friday, Carrey warned of the seriousness of his allegations against Hollywood elite.  “The entertainment industry is the PR and brainwashing branch of the New World Order, the globalist empire of Lucifarianism,” Carrey said, warning. “There will be a strong push to normalize Satanism in 2018.

cc47a246,Time for Answers from Paul Ryan: FAIR Launches Next Phase of its Seven-Figure TV and Radio Ad Campaign against Massive Immigration Increases and Amnesty,"New Wisconsin TV/Radio Ads Questions Ryan's Claim of a Labor Shortage  August 6, 2013 - Washington, D.C. - Beginning the week of August 5, television ads will begin running in Wisconsin taking issue with Rep. Paul Ryan's support for massive increases in immigration to the United States. The ads are being paid for by the Federation for American Immigration Reform FAIR, a national nonpartisan organization that supports enforcement of U.S. immigration laws and overall reductions in immigration to restore a fair labor market for all. The Wisconsin ad buy is over $200,000 and is the next phase of a growing seven figure ad campaign to appear around the country. FAIR has already invested nearly $1 million in radio and TV spots in the first half of 2013 alone. Similar ads will soon appear elsewhere.  The 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee has become a prominent voice in support of granting amnesty to illegal aliens and dramatically increasing future immigration to avert a looming labor shortage in the United States. The ads challenge Ryan to justify his support for massive immigration increases in light of chronically high unemployment across Wisconsin and even in his own congressional district.  Ryan's advocacy for amnesty and immigration increases has intensified as unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin. In June, unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties.  Congressman Ryan needs to explain to thousands of Wisconsin workers, who are struggling to find jobs to support their families, why he wants to increase immigration in order to avert a labor shortage that clearly does not exist, stated Dan Stein, president of FAIR. Wisconsin has 210,000 unemployed workers. Does Congressman Ryan think they're not good enough to get the job done?  Click here to view the ad.",partially false
a2bc40b5,"UPDATE: Klobuchar, Hennepin County Attorney’s Office Refute Claim She Declined To Prosecute Cop At Center Of George Floyd Death","Correction and update: A previous version of this article incorrectly described Sen. Amy Klobuchar D as having “declined to prosecute” Derek Chauvin over a 2006 police-involved shooting while she served as Hennepin County’s top prosecutor from 1999 to 2007. As clarified by the Hennepin County attorney’s office on Friday, “Sen. Klobuchar’s last day in the office here was December 31 2006, and she had no involvement in the prosecution of this case at all.” Klobuchar likewise addressed the claim Friday, describing it as “absolutely false” in an interview with MSNBC. This article has been revised to reflect this correction and include Klobuchar’s response.  In an interview with MSNBC on Friday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar D — one of the leading names on presumptive Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden’s vice presidential list — refuted the claim that while serving as Hennepin County’s top prosecutor from 1999 to 2007 she declined to prosecute the officer charged Friday over the death of George Floyd.  Floyd died on Monday after an arrest that involved four Minneapolis police officers. One of the officers, Derek Chauvin, is seen in a video taken by a bystander as holding his knee on Floyd’s neck for over eight minutes while Floyd tells the officers he cannot breathe. The four officers were fired on Tuesday and Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday on 3rd-degree murder and manslaughter charges for the death of George Floyd.  Amid scrutiny over her former office’s handling of a 2006 case against Chauvin, Klobuchar slammed the claim that she “declined” to prosecute.  “This idea that I somehow declined a case, which has been reported on some news blogs … against this officer is absolutely false,” the senator told MSNBC Friday, as reported by The Hill. “That investigation continued into a time where I was already sworn into the U.S. Senate,” Klobuchar explained. “It was handled and sent to the grand jury by my successor.”  “I never declined [Chauvin’s] case,” she said. “It was handled and sent to the grand jury. When I was county attorney, cases we had involving officer-involved shootings went to a grand jury. I think that was wrong, now. It would have been much better if I took responsibility and looked at cases and made a decision myself.”  Klobuchar’s assertion was confirmed by the Hennepin County attorney’s office on Friday. “Sen. Klobuchar’s last day in the office here was December 31 2006, and she had no involvement in the prosecution of this case at all,” the office said in a statement.  Klobuchar’s record as prosecutor has come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the tragic death of Floyd. The claim that she declined charges against Chauvin followed a report by The Guardian on Chauvin’s police record published Thursday.  In the report, the outlet highlights a 2006 officer-involved shooting case in which Chauvin was one of the officers named in a complaint, and which occurred while Klobuchar was still serving as the county’s top prosecutor.  “Between 1999 and 2007, Klobuchar, the state’s then top prosecutor, declined to press charges against more than a dozen officers accused of killing civilians,” The Guardian reported Thursday. “In 2006, Chauvin was one of several officers involved in the shooting death of a man who stabbed others before turning on the police. Although Klobuchar was the Hennepin county attorney at the time of an October 2006 police shooting involving Chauvin, she did not prosecute and instead the case went to a grand jury that declined to charge the officers with wrongdoing in 2008.”  WXII 12 News reported Thursday that Chauvin “had 18 prior complaints filed against him with the Minneapolis Police Department’s Internal Affairs.”  Klobuchar’s record as a prosecutor came under fire while she was campaigning for president earlier this year after The Associated Press reportedly uncovered new evidence in an investigation into the death of an 11-year-old girl who was killed by a stray bullet while she was at home.  “The senator has repeatedly highlighted Mr. [Myon] Burrell’s conviction in the 2002 case, in which an 11-year-old girl was killed by a stray bullet, as evidence of her history of being tough on crime and seeking justice for African-American communities shaken by gun violence,” The New York Times reported. “But the A.P. article quoted one of Mr. Burrell’s co-defendants as saying that he was in fact the gunman responsible for the murder of the girl, Tyesha Edwards. Mr. Burrell, The A.P. reported, has insisted that he is innocent and has rejected all plea deals.”  The Washington Post highlighted another racially charged case that Klobuchar declined to bring charges in that involved the death of 44-year-old Christopher Burns, an unarmed black man, who died after he was put in a choke hold by law enforcement officers who were responding to a domestic violence call.  “The focus of the community’s anger was Amy Klobuchar, the up-and-coming attorney of Hennepin County, who had declined to prosecute police accused of using excessive force against black suspects,” The Washington Post reported. “At the same time, she aggressively prosecuted smaller offenses such as vandalism and routinely sought longer-than-recommended sentences, including for minors.”  At the beginning of March, while she was still running for president, Klobuchar had to cancel a campaign rally in Minnesota after a large number of protesters stormed the stage demanding that she drop out of the race due to her record as a prosecutor.

6012c7ac,"Teen vaping is an 'epidemic,' FDA declares - blaming Juuls for fueling teen addiction crisis","The Food and Drug Administration FDA declared teen e-cigarette use an epidemic today, threatening to slap manufacturers including Juul with crushing fines if they don't present plans to curb sales to minors.  As of 2017, more than two million high school-age Americans used e-cigarettes, a trend that represents a historic uptake of nicotine products, the FDA said.  Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said that he believes flavored vape liquids target teenagers specifically and his agency is considering banning them altogether.  The FDA has given five companies - Vuse, Blu, JuuL, MarkTen XL, and Logic- 60 days to come up with a plan to keep teenagers from using its devices and sent warning letters to 1,300 companies that it caught selling the device to minors.  The FDA is threatening Juul an other e-cigarette makers with crippling fines if they don't come up with plans to curb sales to minors in an announcement calling teenage vaping an 'epidemic'  While e-cigarettes were first marketed to help adults quit smoking combustible cigarettes, they have now become a gateway to nicotine for teenagers.  The Juul in particular resembles a USB drive, making it easy for teenagers to hide and even bring to school.  Since the surge in teen use of the products began, the FDA and Juul have battled over the products consistently.  Now, Gottlieb is coordinating the largest scale initiative to enforce regulations against selling e-cigarettes to-date.  'We see clear signs that youth use of electronic cigarettes has reached an epidemic proportion,' he said in today's announcement.  Gottlieb reiterated his belief that certain e-cigarette liquid flavors - including sweet ones such as mango and cucumber, popular among teenage Juul users - are particularly enticing and even marketed directly to children.  Budding research on e-cigarettes also suggests that these flavors contain terpenes that may be more damaging to the lungs than other flavors are.  Other studies have indicated that while e-cigarettes may have milder effects on the lungs, they are just as bad - if not worse - for the cardiovascular system, raising risks of heart disease and high blood pressure.  What's more, e-cigarette liquids like Juul pods contain high concentrations of nicotine.  The company recently released new pods that are three percent nicotine, as opposed to the original, potent five percent ones, but in many places these have yet to hit shelves.  These levels of nicotine are highly addictive, particularly to the developing brains of children and teenagers.  Gottlieb noted that the FDA continues to support the availability of products to help adult smokers quit, but 'that work can’t come at the expense of kids,' he said.  Studies published in the last couple of years have suggested that e-cigarettes may in fact act like a gateway to nicotine and other drugs for adolescents, and Gottlieb and the FDA intend to shut those gates, by force, if necessary.  The agency is now demanding plans to reign in youth-targeted marketing campaigns and control illegal sales of their products to minors from Juul and four other e-cigarette makers within 60 days.  'We won’t allow the current trends in youth access and use to continue, even if it means putting limits in place that reduce adult uptake of these products,' Gottlieb said.",partially false

Therefore some details of the gameplay, sporting action, and actual event happenings may be presented in a vague manner. We do not apologize in any way for this inconvenience.  It’s that time of year again, for the bug kahuna of American football, the Superbowl. If you put together how important the sport of arm wrestling was to both Sylvester Stallone and Sammy Hagar in the movie “Over the Top”, that’s how many citizens treat NFL football, with the exception of a few bumblefarts who are still filling their diapers over kneeling or whatever.  This year, Superbowl LV, Arabic shorthand for “55”, was between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Miami Buccaneers. What? Oh, Tampa Bay. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers. And what a contest it was. The Chiefs drew first blood with 3 points, according to Google, thanks to the quick thinking of their one guy that does ads for razors.  Orlando’s star quarterback Peter Brady put on a hell of a show, throwing nearly all of the passes for his entire team. Chief’s QB Joe “Dancy Legs” Barron strove to keep up, and thanks to completions by at least three key guys, probably, gave the Buccs a run for their money.  By now we all know who was victorious and boy, was that exciting, right? Did you see that pass that went right across where the Viagra ad was in the stands?  Absolutely incredible! Mr. You-Know-Who is definitely going to get MVP for that beautiful nonsense!  Anyway, even though the best team won, they’re refusing to go to the White House because the towel boy is a trumptard who thinks the election was somehow stolen, yes, even now. It was decided that nobody wanted the dumbass kid to cry all night, so they told him they cancelled and then locked him in a toilet stall wrapped up in jockstraps.  So maybe it’ll happen later.

d77b2489,Yellow balloons tell tale of student debt ,"A few weeks ago, I stopped by Portland State University to talk with students about the cost of a college education and the debt that is weighing down our students. I walked in to find a room full of students holding yellow balloons with numbers on them that depict the amount of student debt they are expecting to have upon graduation.  The numbers written on those balloons, anywhere from $18,000 to $90,000, were staggering — and a clear demonstration that the price of higher education is much too high.  Our college students face higher costs and greater debt at the same time that it is more imperative to get a good education to succeed in the work force. In Oregon today, the average debt upon college graduation is more than $24,000, with many students in debt $50,000 to $100,000.  Making college affordable is one of the best investments we can make to grow our economy. We should do everything we can to make America a magnet for jobs, ensure our workers have the skills they need to compete, and help Americans get ahead.  If we are to succeed in the 21st century, we need to ensure that our kids can afford the best education possible. But Congress is failing to tackle this issue. A vote to keep student loan rates at 3.4 percent, rather than letting rates double to 6.8 percent on July 1, was defeated by a minority filibuster. This increase will impact every Oregon student securing a new Stafford loan. This is unacceptable.  No one should believe that keeping student loan rates low is unaffordable. The U.S. government will make a profit of more than $50 billion on student loans this coming year. Running up big profits at the expense of our students is just wrong.  Moreover, affordable financing is an issue of setting national priorities. We are spending $120 billion this year in Afghanistan. We must end that war. And as we do, we should invest a big share of those resources in education. Indeed, we should pass the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act that would give students the same rock-bottom interest rates big banks get from the Fed. The biggest banks in the country pay less than 1 percent on funds they borrow from the government. Why should our students pay nine times as much?  Higher education is the surest path to middle-class success and economic opportunity. The last thing we should do at a time when Americans owe more on student loans than credit cards is to make student loans more expensive. That’s why I’ll continue fighting to pass the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, and help reduce the numbers on those yellow balloons.  Our students deserve the opportunity to get the best education in the world without ending up with debt the size of a home mortgage.  It’s clear from my recent visit with those Portland State students that we’ve got a lot of talent here in Oregon. Let’s make sure our talented students can afford a college education to realize their dreams and potential and help build the future economy.  U.S. Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Portland Democrat, was elected in 2008 and is originally from Myrtle Creek. back to top   ",partially false
14696893,"WATCH: Bill Gates Admits His COVID-19 Vaccine Might KILL Nearly 1,000,000 People – The Clover Chronicle","Microsoft co-founder and “philanthropist” Bill Gates recently admitted his vaccine for coronavirus COVID-19 is less effective in the elderly and will most likely result in the death or maiming of 700,000 people. Watch below timestamp 2:35 – Partial transcript: “…The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out the flu vaccine isn’t that effective in elderly people. Most of the benefit comes from younger people not spreading it because they’re vaccinated, and that benefits, on a community basis, the elderly. “Here, we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they’re most at risk of that. And doing that so you amp it up so it works in older people, and yet you don’t have side effects. If we have one in 10,000 side effects, that’s way more, 700,000 people who will suffer from that. “So, really understanding the safety at gigantic scales across all age ranges – you know pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities – it’s very, very hard, and that actual decision of ‘okay, let’s go and give this vaccine to the entire world,’ governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.”",false

Today Tue., the US Navy is positioning Aircraft carriers and their strike groups off both the US east and west coasts. It appears we are preparing to defend ourselves from an invasion. China?  Late Saturday, no fewer than 25 C-17 aircraft were in the skies over the USA, carrying troops and equipment from around the nation . . . ALL going to Nellis Air Force Base. Story Here.  Also late Saturday, no fewer than 12 C-130 aircraft were also on the move, ALSO ALL heading into Nellis.  MAP  On Sunday, locals on and around Nellis reported the base was “swarming” with soldiers and Marines. They also reported seeing a vast array of land fighting vehicles coming out of cargo aircraft.  NAVAL DEPLOYMENTS  This morning, according the the US Naval Institute, the Navy has deployed THREE 3 Aircraft Carriers, plus a Landing Helicopter Dock LHD off the US West Coast, and TWO 2 Aircraft carriers and their Strike Groups plus another LHD off the US East Coast.  Off the West Coast is the USS Carl Vinson in the Pacific NOT AT PORT along the Oregon/Washington Border, the USS Essex LHD off the coast of San Francisco, and the USS Theodore Roosevelt and its Strike Group off the coast of Los Angeles . . .  Off the East Coast are the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower off the Coast of Connecticut, the USS Gerald R. Ford off the coast of New Jersey, and the USS Iwo Jima off the coast of South Carolina . . .  The map below lays out the approximate location of the vessels:  Given these new naval deployments, and the very large, sudden, movement of troops into Nellis AFB, one gets the impression that the United States is preparing to defend its homeland from actual invasion.  Hint: That may actually be the case.  Word in Intelligence circles says that if the Supreme Court voids any or all of the November 3 election due to the massive fraud and violations of the US Constitution with changes to election laws, the lawless extension of voting for weeks, in violation of 3 USC 1 & 2, the Democrats are planning on asking the United Nations to INVADE to depose Trump as a “Dictator.” There is also word within Intelligence circles that the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, plus New York, might actually try to secede from the Union if Trump gets four more years, and may need to be forcibly brought back under US control, the same way renegade southern states were handled back in the 1860’s Civil War.” HT Note: It would gladden my heart to see the US military bombing egomaniac Governor Andrew Cuomo and filthy Commie NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio back into the Union . . . or to Kingdom come . . .  China and Russia are deploying their naval assets in such a way that transit to the US would not take long!  China is positioning out in the Pacific.  Just this morning, the British revealed they have been tracking “the entire Russian Northern Fleet” off the British Coast this month, as the Russians head out into the North Atlantic for . . . . something. Story HERE  One possibility is they are heading toward the Mediterranean to deal with Syria and perhaps Turkey. But what if they’re **NOT** going into the Mediterranean? What if they’re positioning out in the Atlantic to arrive as “requested” along the US East Coast?  It sounds corny, but we won’t know until we know and that will be a few days.  Stay tuned folks.

ec992d76,ICE Detainer Issued for Suspected Wine Country Arsonist in Sonoma Jail,"UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.  The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency ICE issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.  Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.  Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.  Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.  Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency ICE detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.  The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.  The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”  According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.  Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.",false
235d9481,Trump Revokes All of Hillary‘s Privileges as Former First Lady,"As a former First Lady, Hillary Clinton was given many privileges and perks by the government. Some of these perks include access to the White House, free food and drink, free medical care, and $20,000 a month for life. Unfortunately for her, it looks like her free ride is coming to an abrupt end, thanks to President Trump.  President Trump issued an executive order today, nullifying Clinton’s status as a former First Lady, thus removing all of the perks that come with it.  President Trump gave these remarks to the media about the order:  “Hillary Clinton is the worst person in America. She talks very bad about me. She says nasty things. She’s like Obama. Yeah, that Obama is real bad. He says horrible things about me. I would never do that. Why should Hillary get access to the White House and all these perks? She’s a traitor as far as I’m concerned and many people agree with me, many people okay. She’s part of the deep state and a traitor, take her away!”  Republican Joe Barron praised the executive order:  “This is great news! Donald Trump knows what’s best for our country, and if he says Hillary needs to lose her perks, then she needs to lose them. I would never question our President. That’s what they would do in a democracy, and we are a republic, which means we have a King. His name is Donald Trump.”  Rumor has it that Clinton will be selling more uranium to Iran in order to make up for the lost income resulting from Trump’s order. This will open her up to more federal charges, and maybe she will be taken down once and for all. As always Trump is playing 4D chess against her.  Hillary Clinton is a traitor and we are glad to see some fictitious revenge taken against her. This time it will actually be her downfall. We promise.",false
591d494a,ACLU of Florida Responds to U.S. Supreme Court Striking Down Florida Law Setting Strict I.Q. Limit for Executions,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – May 27, 2014  CONTACT: ACLU of Florida Media Office, media@aclufl.org, 786 363-2737    MIAMI, FL – Today, the United States Supreme Court issued a decision striking down a Florida law that set strict criteria based on IQ test scores to determine a defendant’s eligibility for the death penalty.    Howard Simon, Executive Director of the ACLU of Florida, responded to the decision with the following statement:  “No one should be surprised that the U.S. Supreme Court will not permit the Florida legislature to impose the death penalty contrary to what Justice Kennedy declared “our nation's commitment to dignity and its duty to teach human decency as the mark of a civilized world.    “The Supreme Court is telling Florida leaders — who passed the unconstitutional law allowing for the execution of Freddie Hall — that if you want to impose the death penalty, it must be done in a way that respects standards of decency and basic human rights.    “This is not the first time the Legislature has ignored standards of decency set by the U.S. Supreme Court and it likely will not be the last. The strict IQ rule struck down by the Supreme Court today is just one example of the many ways in which our state’s death penalty system falls short of constitutional and human rights standards. We should expect the Supreme Court to take more control over Florida’s death penalty system in the future.    “Florida’s death penalty system is broken, and if state leaders wish to continue sentencing people to die, they must address that system’s failings. Florida is the only state in the country where the vote of a simple majority of jurors can recommend that a person receive a sentence of death. This has contributed to our state’s record of having the most errors and exonerations from death row.    “Unless the Legislature fixes the system by which death can be imposed by the vote of a simple majority, it is likely that the Court will take that – and more -- out of their hands.  Earlier this month, the ACLU of Florida launched a petition calling for a moratorium on executions in Florida.  # # #  About the ACLU of Florida The ACLU of Florida is freedom's watchdog, working daily in the courts, legislature and throughout Florida to defend individual rights and personal freedoms guaranteed by the United States and Florida Constitutions and the Bill of Rights.

c20cb306,"Pedophile’s Decapitated Corpse Found On Judge’s Doorstep After Bail Hearing In Ocala, Florida","The decapitated corpse that was found on a judge’s doorstep in Ocala, Florida has been identified as belonging to a notorious pedophile who was recently allowed to walk free on bail by the judge, according to reports.  William Smith, 28, was discovered in the early hours of Tuesday morning, decapitated and slumped against the front door of the judge who had granted him bail in August.  Smith was arrested last month following allegations by his then girlfriend that he had raped her 8-year-old daughter.  After a police investigation in which Smith was found in possession of child pornography, he was arrested on two counts related to child pornography and one count of child molestation. After being charged, Smith walked free from the court after the judge controversially ruled that he did not pose a threat to the local community, and he raised the $30,000 bail required to trigger his freedom.  The alleged victim’s family said they were “shocked” that Smith had been allowed to walk free from court. Smith was awaiting trial for his crimes and was awaiting a court date which was due to be scheduled for later this year, however it seems that somebody from the local  community decided to take matters into their own hands. The judge, whose name has been withheld, was woken at around 3am by his “frenzied” barking dog. When he went outside to find out what his dog was barking about, he found the decapitated body of the man he had allowed to walk free slumped against his front door with the severed head left on the steps.  Investigating officers described his death scene as resembling a “gangland-style execution“.  A local resident said of the horrific discovery that finding a headless body was an “unusual” occurrence: “This is a nice area.This is the kind of thing that usually happens in mob films, but not around here.”  Police say they are currently “following leads” but have yet to make any arrests for the murder.

3e4a5c46,‘Bionic Man’ Lee Majors Dead At 83;$6 Million Left To Trump 2020 – Today Breaking News,"Do you support Trump YES NO Created with  The man who gave us “The Fall Guy”, “The Six Million Dollar Man” and countless other television and movie roles has left us after complications from a Penuma surgical procedure ended his life. He died peacefully while under anesthesia on the operating table, at the full age of 80.  Majors was best known for his casting as Steve Austin in the popular 70’s television crime drama “The Six Million Dollar Man,” about an accident victim who receives robotic body parts to give him super speed, strength, hearing, and vision. The popularity of this show launched the rest of his very successful career.  Who should become president of USA in 2020? Donald Trump Any other but not trump Create Online  But Majors’ life wasn’t just about acting. He was also a devoted Christian, who supported many religious charities, and a lifelong member of the Republican Party. He never swayed from his support of the GOP, saying that the party’s values were “in line with his own in regard to God, family, religion, and wealth. Republicans are the party Jesus would vote for.”  This loyalty explains the beneficiaries of his last will and testament, namely, his own church as well as the campaign to re-elect President Trump. Majors left 66% of his sizeable $9 million estate to Trump 2020 – a symbolic total of $6 million. An excerpt from his will showed his love for our President:  “President Trump has shown the leadership and strength that this country has lacked for decades. My contribution will go to him but will really be for America. The amount is bionic. I hope it gives the USA power. I know Steve Austin would approve.”  Thank you Lee. RIP",false

b9bf498d,BLM Has Rules for Whites Attending Protests,"0 SHARES Share Tweet BLM pasted these “rules” for “white folks” attending protests on social media. Many whites wanted to stand in unity with their fellow blacks to protest the unjust killing of George Floyd’s. In a moment of unity, these rules seem more degrading and racist towards white people. Among some of the rules, they request whites to “stay in the back until you are called forward. If you hear “White people to the front” or “Allies to the front” step forward and link arms with other white people to form a human shield.” So they asked that all whites stay in the back and link arms with other whites, not blacks. Seems those that are crying for equality don’t want equality, they want superiority over whites. Unity is when we unite side by side together in a common goal. So why would they not use this moment to show that we can all one? BLM Mohawk Kuzma said this in 2014: “As organizer of the largest Black Lives Matter marches in Seattle since 2014, Mohawk Kuzma has had a front-row seat to the transforming demographics of the BLM movement. He says that my eyes are not deceiving me. There is a noticeable increase of white marchers, one that he says signifies that white Seattleites’ long hibernation on Black issues is at its end. “The reason BLM marches are getting more white is because more white people are waking up and seeing the covert segregation and racial injustice and racism,” Kuzma tells me. “We see it on the news every day across the nation.” He draws a connection with the overt displays of racism, from pervasive police killings of blacks to the recent domestic terrorist acts by white supremacists, most recently a school shooting by one in New Mexico Kuzma says that when he began organizing he welcomed whatever race, gender, or orientation felt compelled to attend, as long as the marchers understood “that all black lives matter and racial injustice, police brutality, and racism needed to stop.” However, he also recognizes that the increased numbers of white folks is a double-edged sword. “More white people also brings white ignorance and white fragility,” he says. “White people think they have to be respectful during a protest. Sorry, but we as black people don’t get respect from anyone, including white people, so why should we be respectful. We are here to get stuff done.” During the Civil War, it was white people that fought for the freedom of slaves. At that time the north had 22 million people against slavery while the south had 9 million. 4 million of them were slaves. It was white people that ran the underground railroad. It has always true that more white people are fighting for equal rights than not. Though many seem to want to overlook this historical fact. This movement is an American movement and we should have mutual respect for each other. We should treat each other how we expect to be treated.

2563d5d5,A Letter from the Nye County Chairman,"Update: some have asked why I didn’t sign my name to this post. The answer is simple: the intended audience was our rural membership and they all know me.  As I write to you today, I have no doubt that this letter will find many of you crushed under the weight of despair or perhaps lost in a maze of confusion. It is my hope that by the time you finish reading this letter you will be able to confidently join millions of others who support the president and another four years.  Let me be clear: Trump will be president for another four years. Biden will not be president. Yes, I know those are shocking words in these crazy days.  I have been approached by many saying, “It’s over…” and “Trump conceded the election…”. Nothing of the sort has taken place. Go back and listen to the videos all the way through. At no point does Trump even mention Biden’s name. At no point does he say he concedes. He does say that there will be a peaceful transition to a new administration and he does say that this is only the beginning. Those phrases are important to note. Indeed, we will have a new administration made up of a new vice president and cabinet as the current ones have all made their treason complete. I will touch on this in more detail shortly.  We do well to remember that for more than four years Donald Trump has been five steps ahead of everyone in every attempt to derail him, impeach him, or confound him. For example, he announced on election night in the early hours of the morning that he “didn’t want a dump of ballots at 4AM.” What happened in just a few short hours at almost exactly 4AM? A huge ballot dump took place which showed that he already knew that it was going to take place. That was a public word to the enemies of our country that he was on to them. Also, consider the recent incident at the capitol building in DC. Trump was late to his speaking engagement and then spoke on a number of rehashed things to the crowd of 500K+ but this created a problem. You see, if Trump had spoken on time and briefly, the MAGA crowd would have been at the capitol building with the Antifa faction and likely would have been drawn into the fray by accident and confusion due to the crowd size. With Trump speaking late and long, the MAGA crowd was PROTECTED and SEPARATED from the Antifa groups. It would be very clear that the disguised Antifa people were 95%+ of the people in the building. Again, Trump countered because he was steps ahead of them. This was clearly a staged event meant to blame Trump supporters and try to frame Trump so the 25th amendment could be used by Congress but it failed. Nevermind the numerous videos showing the police opening the gates for Antifa they didn’t fight their way in and then leading them throughout the building.  I say all this as only two examples out of many that at no point has our president been in a fight of desperation.  Now you may ask, “Why hasn’t Trump arrested anyone yet? Why did this have to go all the way to Congress?” Multiple reasons: first, Trump has been adamant in following the rule of law and the Constitution. He gives everyone, no matter how dirty, an opportunity to do the right thing sometimes with warnings such as the phone call with the Georgia Secretary of State recently. He pushed cases through the courts, he presented evidence to the legislatures, and he even told the vice president to do the right thing. But with the betrayal by Pence and Congress, the treason is now complete and nobody can say that Trump did not allow the process to finish before acting. Second, in order to drain the swamp you have to know who are the swamp creatures. They can blend in very well with the crowds. But the false event in the capitol revealed the final traitors for who they were regardless of party affiliation. Trump flushed them out of hiding.  I need to take a moment to speak on Pence. With his treason completed, many of you may not know of his dealings and political posturing prior to the infamous day in the capitol. Pence was already wheeling and dealing way back during the 2016 election season with…wait for it….Paul Ryan. Remember Ryan? The RINO speaker of the house? Look at these emails that were recently revealed:  Pence was also involved with a scheme to oust Trump sometime during his first four years that was orchestrated by Rod Rosenstein and supported by the Clintons. The plan: get rid of Trump, become president and then appoint Rod Rosenstein as the new VP. Why would they want that? Because they felt Pence could be controlled. See these links for the 3 part series for more information:  More could be said but I don’t want this letter to become more of a book than it already is. Suffice it to say that when Trump said at the DC rally that he hoped Pence would do the right thing, he already knew what he was going to do but was, yet again, giving the man space to choose to do the right thing.  Now, nobody has been more supportive of Trump than Lin Wood. This man’s career has been fighting defamation lawsuits which means that he doesn’t say things, no matter how outrageous they may seem, without them being true as he knows the consequences of slander. With this in mind, Lin Wood has become a fountain of information and leaks of hitherto unknown information revealing some of the depths of corruption and evil in our highest offices. This is the same man who recently said that arrests are coming over the next few days. He called Pence a traitor well before the counting of the elector votes on the 6th. But did you know that he also said that the president, following the capitol incident, left DC on a “Doomsday” aircraft used for communications in the event of a nuclear war with his family and was in Abilene, TX. This aircraft was confirmed by both flight trackers and eyes on the ground. In short, he is a trustworthy source of information. If you have a means to follow Lin Wood on Parler, I would highly recommend that you do so to stay abreast of things taking place. You can also listen to this podcast: Podcast  So, what comes next? I don’t have the particulars but I can give you milestones to watch for as the coming days unfold:  Expect the emergency broadcast system to be activated. The FCC just recently released a memorandum speaking to the requirements under Federal law to send messages from the president to the public. See this link Expect confusion. We are in a battle for our republic against elites that are attempting the very coup that they are accusing Trump of doing. In battle, there will be disinformation but know that plans are being fulfilled. Expect high profile arrests to take place over the next 12 days and at any time. You may wake one morning to find someone in high office is no longer there. Expect this to be a bumpy ride to the very end. This is not a television show where things are resolved in 45 minutes. Expect more bombshell evidence to be released between now and Jan. 20th. Expect some sort of internet blackout or outage: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Gmail are likely going to be affected. If you don’t have alternate forms of communication established now, it would be a good idea to start forming them even if it’s just checking on your nextdoor neighbors. Expect Trump to be inaugurated on Jan 20th! Expect the executive order from 2018 and/or the Insurrection Act to be enacted. This DOES NOT mean martial law. Remember that we have been under a state of emergency since 2018 which gives the president many powers to act.  These things may happen out of the order listed and some may happen multiple times. As I have been watching closely, many things have been and are in play as we speak. Remember that Trump has not and will not give up. He actually takes his oath of office to defend the Constitution against enemies foreign and domestic very seriously. This is why they are so panicked in DC: they know that Trump will fight while Congress just rolls over.  I’ve mentioned this before but it bears repeating. None of us would have believed what we all now know except that Trump and his team have painstakingly taken the time to show the public. Want to show what Congress thinks of you? Highlight that the stimulus bill only sent $600 to each American but billions to other countries payoffs, money laundering. Want to show the extent of collusion with the CCP at all levels of government? Bring multiple lawsuits against the election fraud from the local courts all the way to the Supreme Court which will show just how brazenly treasonous the judges are. Want the public to see how rigged the election system has been for many years? Present the evidence openly as we have seen. Even this week we have sworn testimony out of Italy that the Leonardo defense contractor used satellites to change the votes from our election in the USA from Italy. These Dominion voting machines were actively sending data to Germany, Serbia, China, Iran, and now Rome. This corruption is MUCH bigger than any of us expected but none of us would have believed it until now. This is why things seem to have taken so long.  Now, the American public is awake and ready to take back their long forgotten responsibilities to hold the elected officials accountable. I have heard from many of you how upset you are with the obvious and willful disregard for the truth and for justice.  As the days unfold, let’s maintain communications among ourselves and try to help our neighbor to understand what is happening. Turn off the television as they have demonstrated they are clearly only falsifying the media to maintain control over your thinking. Do not despair but pray for our country, for Trump and his supporters, and for a national repentance to be stirred nationwide.  The next 12 days will be something to tell the grandchildren!

f6caca51,Chelsea Clinton Ranked World’s 18th Richest Woman,"Chelsea Clinton. Children’s book author, global health initiative spokesperson, former news correspondent, executive serving on numerous corporate boards including the Clinton Foundation. Now, her list of accolades can include jet-setting billionaire, as Forbes magazine has recently named her the 18th richest woman on the planet. Assuming the planet was an alternate Earth.  According to several experts wearing ties and carrying briefcases in my imagination, the youngest Clinton has parlayed her savings into a number of profitable investments including organic apple-marijuana farming, a frozen line of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and ownership of a company responsible for building complex Christian-head-cutter-offer machines for Fema when the time comes. Her instincts are legendary.  Mother of three children by her investment banker husband who, despite the feverish oxycontin fantasies of the tragically teabagged, is in no way related to George Soros, the businesswoman is also a frequent contributor to news magazines such as Time, Newsweek, and Highlights, and has won several prestigious awards for her work. Meanwhile, White House aides pat President Trump gently on the top of his head anytime he correctly pronounces his son Barron’s name.  Clinton moved up the list from last year’s 21st position, beating out luminaries such as Gwen Stefani, whose line of “Hollaback Girl” tinfoil lingerie proved too controversial for most of the American consumers, and Fox News personality Judge Jeanine Pirro, who spent much of her lying to old people fortune on plastic surgery which failed to make her look any less like the mother character in “Orange is the New Black” with a facially-concentrated yeast infection.  So it appears that another Clinton has joined the ranks of driving jealous conservatives into conniption fits. Let’s hope the supermarkets have stocked up on Depends.",false

0a047927,Republican Party of Wisconsin Launches Radio Ads Against Four Democrats Running for Governor in Closing Days of Primary,"Ads highlight major flaws in the records of top remaining candidates  August 1, 2018  [Madison, WI] — Today, the Republican Party of Wisconsin is launching four radio ads against the leading Democrat candidates for governor in the closing days of the primary, hitting each candidate in key media markets as they continue to engage in their dangerous race to the left. Upon the launch of the ads, the Republican Party of Wisconsin is releasing the following statement from Executive Director Mark Morgan:  “Whether it’s Tony Evers failing families, Matt Flynn bullying victims of sexual abuse, Mahlon Mitchell abusing his position, or Kelda Roys putting families in danger, Democrats are locked into a dangerous race to the left. Wisconsin voters can’t trust any one of these candidates to keep them safe or fight for their best interests.”  The ads will initially run in markets statewide, targeting Democrat candidates for governor Tony Evers, Matt Flynn, Mahlon Mitchell, and Kelda Roys. Listen to the ads below:  “Failed,” On Tony Evers Failing Families:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As Superintendent of Schools, Tony Evers sided with union bosses and failed to take the license of a teacher who was found to be spreading pornography at school and making inappropriate comments about the bodies of middle school girls – despite outcry from parents.  In a similar case from before he was an elected official, Evers signed off on a license revocation for a teacher watching pornography at school – showing Evers failed to consistently implement the law and that his excuses for inaction on previous cases ring hollow.  “Silent,” On Matt Flynn Bullying Victims of Abuse:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As a defense attorney, Flynn threatened to throw victims of sexual abuse “crumbs.”  A letter unveiled by the Republican Party of Wisconsin detailed how Flynn provided sexual predators with direct legal counsel.  Despite all of this, most of his fellow Democrat candidates for governor have failed to call on Flynn to drop out of the race.  “Abusing,” On Mahlon Mitchell Abusing His Position:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:  As a union boss, Mahlon Mitchell took a massive raise on the backs of hard-working Wisconsin firefighters.  Mitchell used his union’s political arm as his own political slush funded, donating to far-left candidates and causes. The union even gave Mitchell’s campaign $40,000 in 2012.  “Can’t Trust,” On Kelda Roys Putting Families in Danger:  LISTEN HERE  FACTS ON AD HERE:",partially false
fe7d514e,Democrats Want Stimulus Payments Taken from Social Security and Military,"Recently, the most generous economic stimulus payments in the history of our great nation were announced. An overwhelming percentage of the people will get $1,200 each, including our senior citizens and our tremendous military members and President Trump was proud to sign the bill, which will offer relief to millions.  Enter the socialist Democrats. Rarely pennywise and always pound-foolish, they have unilaterally decided that those who are on Social Security and members of the military already make enough money and that these payments will be preemptively taken from their upcoming pay.  Obviously this will have effect of making it difficult for those people to live until they get their government bailout. Seniors will be eating cat food. Soldiers will be eating each other. Do the Democrats care? Of course not.  Nancy Pelosi’s spokesman Joe Barron said:  “$1,200 is nothing. 4 days max of beer money for Speaker Pelosi. They should have prepared for this better. Seniors should be rationing their medications and throw away their cell phones. They’re worthless. A drain on society. I don’t feel bad for them at all. They think they are the greatest generation but most of them can’t even find their dentures. And don’t even get me started on the military. All they want to do wear a uniform and shoot guns. We let them do that. They shouldn’t be paid one cent.”  Donald Trump is a President for all of the people. The Democrats are in it for lazy freeloaders and illegal aliens and don’t care about our seniors and military. Be sure to vote them all out this November!",false
2427fce3,"Former Chief Science Officer for Pfizer Says Second Wave Faked on False-Positive COVID Tests, Pandemic is Over","In a stunning development, a former Chief Science Officer for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer says there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen. The Big Pharma insider asserts that false positive results from inherently unreliable COVID tests are being used to manufacture a second wave based on new cases.  Dr. Mike Yeadon, a former Vice President and Chief Science Officer for Pfizer for 16 years, says that half or even almost all of tests for COVID are false positives. Dr. Yeadon also argues that the threshold for herd immunity may be much lower than previously thought, and may have been reached in many countries already.  In an interview last week Dr. Yeadon was asked:  we are basing a government policy, an economic policy, a civil liberties policy, in terms of limiting people to six people in a meeting...all based on, what may well be, completely fake data on this coronavirus?  Dr. Yeadon answered with a simple yes.  Even more significantly, even if all positives were to be correct, Dr. Yeadon said that given the shape of all important indicators in a worldwide pandemic, such as hospitalizations, ICU utilization, and deaths, the pandemic is fundamentally over.  Yeadon said in the interview:  Were it not for the test data that you get from the TV all the time, you would rightly conclude that the pandemic was over, as nothing much has happened. Of course people go to the hospital, moving into the autumn flu season...but there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen.  In a paper published this month, which was co-authored by Yeadon and two of his colleagues, How Likely is a Second Wave?, the scientists write:  It has widely been observed that in all heavily infected countries in Europe and several of the US states likewise, that the shape of the daily deaths vs. time curves is similar to ours in the UK. Many of these curves are not just similar, but almost super imposable.  In the data for UK, Sweden, the US, and the world, it can be seen that in all cases, deaths were on the rise in March through mid or late April, then began tapering off in a smooth slope which flattened around the end of June and continues to today. The case rates however, based on testing, rise and swing upwards and downwards wildly.  Media messaging in the US is already ramping up expectations of a second wave.",false
efc2b0ac,Michelle Obama Calls Candace Owens : ‘Aunt Tom’,"In a pre-taped interview with CNN’s Don Lemon this week, former First Lady and bestselling author and filmmaker Michelle Obama had some surprisingly unladylike things to say about some conservative pundits. The segment, to air Monday, is causing internet hullabaloo as some of the leaked footage went viral.  Lemon began the interview with standard questions, pressing the megastar for her views on current events, ranging from *President Trump’s handling of the pandemic event to the civil unrest brought on by protests surrounding the death of unarmed victim George Floyd by abusive and overzealous racist police officers. Obamawatcher received a sample of the tape from hacktivist Sandra Batt of the New York Daily Queefer:  “What really bothers me are these phony conservative Fox News morons inciting violence and spreading their racism to Trump’s already mentally defective base. Candace Owens, for example. That ‘Aunt Tom’ as I call her for selling out her own people, should be dropped into the middle of an Alabama rodeo. Let’s see what kind of cheers come out of THOSE stands. I think saying ‘black republican’ is the same as saying ‘horny eunuch’. I mean, it’s a dichotomy. It’s like all the idiots on Facebook who think MLK was a Republican. People like that are why we have to put instructions on shampoo bottles.”  Michelle’s husband Barack has been making a lot of news lately, so it seems appropriate that Mrs. O would choose to shoot herself into the spotlight now. It’s always been a characteristic of the Obama family to speak out and speak loud, no matter the consequences. It’s that latter part that always seems to bite back on the *President when he attempts to do the same, only far more stupidly.",false
0c8df55f,Paul Ryan’s Worst Ally - The New York Times,"WHATEVER drama plays out when Republicans meet in Cleveland next week to nominate their party’s presidential candidate, the most consequential story line might well be the nationally televised debut of the awkward political partnership between Donald J. Trump, the presumptive nominee, and House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, the highest-ranking elected Republican and thus chairman of the convention. But it offers just a sample of the spectacles sure to ensue between them should Mr. Trump become president.  How could Mr. Ryan, for years his party’s self-styled ideas guy, share power with a president whose ill-formed, often baffling ideas are in significant cases the opposite of his own, and of conservatives generally — on trade, Medicare and Social Security, immigration policy and more?  Could Mr. Ryan, as he suggests, really expect compromise from Mr. Trump, who has already served notice that Republican congressional leaders should “just be quiet” and leave running the country to him? Might Mr. Ryan even use the House’s legislative power to block some initiatives, though President Trump would be certain to claim a mandate for them? Where difficult trade-offs are needed to bring Trumpian ideas into legislative reality, can Mr. Ryan corral support from his fractious Republican colleagues and even a few Democrats when necessary?  That last question suggests another, bigger one that predates the Trump ascendance: Can Mr. Ryan himself compromise in the interest of getting legislation signed into law? Many in both parties have come to doubt it after 17 years in which the 46-year-old congressman from Wisconsin has held increasingly influential positions in the House, with Republicans holding a majority for all but four of those years.",partially false
2ae2f621,Workers get new rights in overhaul but zero-hours contracts remain,"The government has introduced what it claims to be the biggest package of workplace reforms for 20 years after concerns that ministers have failed to appeal to voters who are “just about managing”.  Legislation that comes into effect on Monday will increase fines for employers who have deliberately victimised their staff, and give workers details of their rights from the first day in their job.  The reforms, outlined by the business secretary Greg Clark, plan to stop the “unfair” use of pay-between-assignment contracts which allow businesses to opt out of equal pay arrangements for agency employees. Measures will also be taken to ensure that seasonal workers get the paid time off they are entitled to.  The reforms will be seen as a direct appeal to Labour voters and an attempt to get back to the values expressed by Theresa May in July 2016. In her first speech as prime minister, May said: “If you’re from an ordinary working class family, life is much harder than many people in Westminster realise. You have a job but you don’t always have job security.” She pledged to protect those who were “just about managing”.  Labour has questioned whether the plans will do anything for people on zero-hours contracts. Unions said the reforms were a missed opportunity to rebalance power in the gig economy.  The reforms, covered in a report called the Good Work Plan, are based on the recommendations made by former Tony Blair adviser Matthew Taylor in his review into employment, especially in the so-called gig economy. The government has pledged to implement 51 of Taylor’s suggested 53 reforms.  Legislation will be introduced to give workers details of their rights from the first day in a job, such as eligibility for sick leave, pay levels, maternity and paternity leave.  The maximum employment tribunal fines for employers demonstrated to have shown malice, spite or gross oversight will increase from £5,000 to £20,000.  Ministers are also committing to legislate to improve employment status tests to “reflect the reality of the modern working relationships”. Despite calls from unions, the government said the reforms would not ban zero-hours contracts, in keeping with Taylor’s recommendations, because that would “negatively impact” more people than it helped.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady welcomed some reforms such as the decision to scrap the so-called “agency worker loophole”.  However, Grady said the government had missed an opportunity to bolster the rights of zero-hours workers. “These reforms as a whole won’t shift the balance of power in the gig economy. Unless unions get the right to organise and bargain for workers in places like Uber and Amazon, too many working people will continue to be treated like disposable labour.  “The right to request guaranteed working hours is no right at all. Zero-hours contract workers will have no more leverage than Oliver Twist,” she said.  Rebecca Long Bailey, shadow business secretary, said the reforms will do little to combat the government’s attacks on workers’ rights such as an increase in employment tribunal fees, the Trade Union Act and low wage growth.  “These proposals do nothing to tackle the growing number of people on precarious zero-hours contracts and with their botched Brexit deal threatening jobs and rights they’ll have to do a lot more than this to reassure workers,” she said.  The government claims the reforms will make the UK the first country in the world to address the opportunities and challenges of the gig economy and its impact on a modern economy.  They form a key part of the government’s modern industrial strategy, a long-term plan to help businesses create better, higher-paying jobs in every part of the UK.  Clark said: “The world of work is changing, bringing new opportunities for innovative businesses and new business models to flourish, creating jobs across the country and boosting our economy.  “Today’s largest upgrade in workers’ rights in over a generation is a key part of building a labour market that continues to reward people for hard work, that celebrates good employers and is boosting productivity and earning potential across the UK.”  Taylor told the Guardian: “I think this is a welcome and substantive response from the government and will make a real difference to the working lives of millions of workers, particularly those in the most vulnerable positions.”  One business representative broadly welcomed the suggested reforms. Matthew Fell, CBI chief UK policy director, said: “Businesses support a strong floor of workplace rights, and it’s right that these laws keep pace with changes in the economy and society.  “They welcome a new law giving all workers the right to request more predictable working hours which will help to facilitate the conversations that are essential to ensuring flexibility benefits both parties.  “However, legislation to amend employment status rules risks making the law less able to adapt to new forms of work in the future,” he said.",false
0b348ddd,WATCH: Pelosi Confirms ‘China Would Prefer Joe Biden’,"EDITOR’S NOTE: This story about Chinese Communist Party influence in U.S. elections is currently being suppressed by Facebook’s fact-checker “Lead Stories” which recently announced a partnership with the Chinese Communist Party-linked app TikTok.  Lead Stories is run by former CNN staf f, managed from Belgium, and their staff donate almost exclusively to Democratic Party candidates. Our original story continues below, unchanged, and factually accurate.  Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi confirmed this weekend that “China would prefer Joe Biden” to win the upcoming presidential election. The news follows months of National Pulse reporting linking the Democratic Presidential candidate to the Chinese Communist Party.  During an exchange on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Pelosi effectively confirmed a National Counterintelligence and Security Center NCSC report which concluded China “prefers President Trump doesn’t win re-election.”  The news will take the wind out of the sails of the left’s claims that President Trump has not been tough on China, and plants Joe Biden squarely in Beijing’s corner in November:  “The Chinese… what they said is [that] China would prefer [Biden]. Whether they do, that’s their conclusion. That they would prefer Joe Biden.“  WATCH:  China would prefer Joe Biden. – Nancy Pelosi pic.twitter.com/gI1RHmFNOu — Francis Brennan @FrancisBrennan August 9, 2020  Pelosi also failed to disavow the foreign election interference occurring at the hands of China – a hypocritical stance in light of her unfounded fearmongering over Russian interference in the 2016 election.  And the prospect of election interference at the hands of the CCP is considerably more likely.  As the NCSC’s report notes: “We assess that China prefers that President Trump – whom Beijing sees as unpredictable – does not win reelection. China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter criticism of China.”  The charges are not far-fetched.  While serving as Senator and Vice President, Biden championed trade deals and economic policies amenable to the Chinese Communist Party CCP and, as a private-sector continuation of Biden’s China appeasement, his family members have profited immensely from countless deals with CCP-run companies.",false

The Bible has long been controversial when it comes to race, suggesting that Jesus Christ can break down barriers between people groups through the blood of His cross and callously proclaiming that everyone is made in God's image and has inherent dignity and worth because of God's infinite worth.  We're trying to stoke racial tensions, and the Bible is extremely unhelpful at a time like this, said one activist. Pulling the book will go a long way toward progressing the race war. If everyone believed what the Bible said, we'd have no racial divisions to exploit. Can you imagine all the peace and harmony that would break out?

4f74a1b2,AOC Proposes Ending Social Security Benefits After Age 75,"We all know that Democrats do not care about senior citizens. It’s almost like they have no elderly family members themselves. Of course, they do and we can only assume they don’t care about them either.  The latest Democrat scheme involves AOC, yet again trying to muck up our Social Security system.  This is her latest proposal is a doozy:  “Look, these people are a burden on society. This is a capitalist society in which we let the weak die so that the strong may thrive, so that is what I intend to do. Seniors get enough handouts as it is, so I say we put a cap on it. If you reach the age of 75 and still can’t support yourself on your own, then perhaps you made bad life choices. Maybe they should pull themselves up by the bootstraps or something. Why should the taxpayer have to subsidize your poor decisions? They will no longer have to under my proposal.”  These are such horrible words coming from someone that is supposed to represent “we the people.”  She is casting aside seniors as second-class like Republicans typically do to anyone who isn’t rich. What’s next? Taking away their right to vote? This is a very dangerous and wet slippery slope that we cannot afford to go down. There is too much at stake.  Luckily, many Republicans agree, including our very own, Senator Joe Barron. He said he has confirmed that he will be voting next month to impeach AOC for “unlawful acts,” whatever that means. This sounds like a good first step in the right direction.  For years, Republicans have chipped away at social net programs that progressives like AOC normally support. Yet, it’s AOC who needs to go, according to the taters who share and read the first few paragraphs of this story.",false
09186525,Swedish Microchipping Photos Flood Social Media And It’s Insane,"Swedish corporations are now implanting their workers with microchips. Employees are taking to social media and posting the surgical procedure photos.  Swedish medical staff surgically implants the chips into the area between the thumb and index finger. The goal is to offer Swedes more convenience in everyday life. Earlier this month, we reported that U.K. companies are beginning to ask that their employees be microchipped similar to the Swedes.  Many Swedish companies ask employees to voluntarily sign up for a microchip implant. And workers are accepting the offers and volunteering to have the procedures done. Of course, one must consider the ramifications of such “volunteer-based” microchipping. I’ll get to that in a bit.  Swedish Microchip Procedures Pictures Flood Instagram  Sandra Wuerthner posted images of what we assume to be her and her coworkers post-op.  Here’s a medical professional implanting Wuerthner with a microchip.  In this image we can see the microchip protruding from, we suspect, Wuerthner’s skin. seriously, this is baffling.  Here’s an Instagram post of a Swedish citizen bragging about his XRAY, which exposes his rice-sized microchip.  Microchipping Is Voluntary  Corporations are likely to keep microchipping of employees voluntary, but conspiracy theories continue to grow nevertheless.  The corporation’s protocols, access points, and conveniences will be geared towards chipped employees. But those who don’t feel comfortable with a microchip will experience the same access they normally would.

a5a086c7,Low-paid workers unable to escape poverty trap - report,"The extent to which low-paid workers in the UK stay trapped in poverty is highlighted by a report showing only one in four workers who were low-paid in 2001 – and who have remained in employment for most of the subsequent decade – went on to escape poverty and move on to higher pay.  The findings come in a report by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, requested by the government commission on social mobility.  The report finds that among the three-quarters of workers who were low-paid a decade ago, the majority cycled between low and higher pay over the course of the decade. Just 12% of those who stayed in employment were stuck in low pay every year of that decade.  The value of escaping low pay can be considerable, the report finds. The “escapers” saw their wages grow by an average 7.5% in real terms over the course of a decade, bringing their pay to around the level of typical workers. Those unable to escape low pay saw their wages grow half as fast at 3.6% a year in real terms.  Key characteristics of escapers include having or obtaining a degree, possessing a positive outlook for the future and working for a large employer defined as a company with 1,000-plus employees.  A key barrier to pay progression appears to be working part-time, alongside other factors such as being older, a single parent or disabled.  Workers also tend to stay on low pay if they are in specific industries, such as sales or hospitality. Fewer than one in five workers in the hospitality sector manage any serious pay progression.  The report looks at workers who were low paid in 2001, and who were in work for the majority of the subsequent decade, with at least three of those years being consecutive. An employee is judged to have escaped low pay if they were low paid in 2001 and moved on to wages above low pay in the final three years of the decade. Those who are stuck in low pay are defined as employees who were low paid in 2001 and have worked for the majority of the subsequent decade, but who have earned below the low-pay threshold in every year they have worked. The low-pay threshold is defined as two-thirds of median hourly earnings. In 2013, the threshold was £7.69.  Vidhya Alakeson, the deputy chief executive at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Britain has a long-standing low-pay problem, with over a fifth of the workforce in poorly paid jobs. But the limited opportunities for escaping low pay is just as big a concern as it has huge consequences for people’s life chances.”  Alan Milburn, the chair of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, said: “The majority of Britain’s poorest paid workers never escape the low-pay trap. Too many simply cycle in and out of low-paying jobs instead of being able to move up the pay ladder. Any sort of work is better than no work but being in a job does not guarantee a route out of poverty.  “This research provides compelling evidence for employers and government to do more on pay progression. It is a powerful argument for Britain to become a ‘living wage’ country.”  The CBI annual conference in London this week highlighted the squeeze on living standards and called for government measures to help the poorest in work, including cutting national insurance costs and helping potential workers who have very young children.  In a significant shift on Monday, Britain’s bosses called for action to tackle the living standards crisis, by lifting the lowest paid out of national insurance and expanding free childcare. The CBI also discussed what business could do to tackle low pay.  Sir Michael Rake, the CBI president, said: “Falling real wages – a price worth paying to preserve jobs during and after the recession – cannot go on for much longer. For those currently in low-paying jobs or trying for entry-level roles, business has to do much more to help them climb the ladder and progress. We want to see the benefits of a growing economy translated into better opportunities for all people.”  Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, told the CBI he thought the squeeze on living standards was a lagging indicator and would end soon. He said persistent low productivity in the UK was a puzzle and one reason for the slow rise in earnings may be due to the number of relatively low-paid young workers joining the employment market.",false
ef0ab41b,Exclusive: The TCF Center Election Fraud – Newly Discovered Video Shows Late Night Deliveries of Tens of Thousands of Illegal Ballots 8 Hours After Deadline,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: Schumer, McConnell Reach Agreement on Trump Impeachment Trial - Here Are the Details  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat present during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.  Here is our video on the election fraud in the Detroit TCF Center on election night:  Special thanks to Cassandra Fairbanks who did an outstanding job on this project.  ** PLEASE SUPPORT THE GATEWAY PUNDIT’S DOCUMENTATION OF MICHIGAN VOTER FRAUD.

e47f8003,Gov. DeSantis Tells Biden: “Go Fuck Yourself”,"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday did not mince words on a congested conference call with Biden and federal health authorities who are seeking to prohibit domestic travel to and from the Sunshine State. DeSantis and Biden exchanged salvos of biting barbs after the criminal president said the federal government had authority to “restrict movement” of the people.  Citing concerns over the widespread proliferation of Covid-19 variants, Biden said he might have to prohibit vehicle and air traffic until the CDC and NIH were confident that currently available vaccinations had a proven efficacy against emerging strains, such as highly transmissible anomalies from the United Kingdom, Brazil, and South Africa.  Also on the call were “Deep State” Dr. Fauci and acting CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, both of whom championed Biden’s idea and told DeSantis that surging cases in Florida threatened to undermine the federal government’s expansive efforts to mitigate spread across the country. Florida, Dr. Fauci said, was the epicenter of Covid-19 mutations, and argued that new variants accounted for between 15-35% of new cases in Florida.  Walensky argued on the call that any attempt by DeSantis to resist a federally mandated travel ban would be immoral, selfish, and possibly illegal.  Biden echoed her words, and he berated DeSantis for having left Florida’s economy open during “the dark days of Covid.” Moreover, Biden claimed he had unilateral and constitutional authority to protect the nation’s health from “rogue politicians” acting in contravention of established health guidelines.  DeSantis’s initial reply was brief and blunt: “I will not comply,” he said, and then cited the CDC’s own statistics showing a nationwide decline in active Covid-19 cases.  Florida had arrested the spread of Covid-19, DeSantis argued, and accused Biden of targeting Republican states that supported Donald Trump.  “Florida absolutely will not comply,” DeSantis repeated. “Instituting a travel ban or restriction of movement would be a gross example of federal overreach with no grounding in law or science. We have Covid-19 in check, and you’re trying to exert unlawful authority over our state and its people,” he chided Biden.  Biden then tacitly threatened to withhold federal funding and to deny Florida access to Covid-19 vaccinations.  “C’mon, man, Florida needs our help, and you need vaccines, which are hard to come by, isn’t that right, Dr. Fauci,” Biden said.  The “Deep State” doctor replied in the affirmative, telling DeSantis that he expects the prevalence of the UK variant to double or triple every week to 10 days.  “Governor, do you want to be responsible for reinfecting the nation? Truth is, we don’t even know how effective current vaccines are against the UK strain.”  DeSantis told Dr. Fauci he trusted his own state health authorities over financially incentivized federal officials.  “How much do you stand to earn from these vaccines, Dr. Fauci? And, Joe, if you continue with this course of action, I will authorize the state National Guard to protect the movement of Floridians,” DeSantis said.  “Address me as Mr. President or President Biden,” Biden said.  “I will not, and you can go fuck yourself,” DeSantis said before hanging up.  In closing, it seems obvious that Team Biden favors perpetual lockdowns and a stagnant economy, keeping Americans imprisoned under a de facto state of medical martial law.

e3f7f045,Breaking: United Nations Orders Trump To Stand Down In Portland,"The United Nations just ordered the Trump administration to stand down in Portland!  This is what we have been warning about.  For over a month, the United Nations has been carrying out a 'human rights investigation' against the United States. First, they were investigating the US over systemic racism. They ordered the United States to crack down on police officers, otherwise the UN would mount an intervention. Yes, this is really what the UN Human Rights Council said last month…  When they learned that only 9 unarmed black people were shot by police last year, and of them, only two were not in the process of attacking a police officer or bystander, the UN shifted their strategy. They realized that they cannot launch a blue-helmet intervention on such a flimsy basis.  So, they shifted to investigating the Trump administration's handling of protesters. There were plenty of peaceful protesters marching in early and mid June. But these protests stopped being peaceful and stopped being about George Floyd a long time ago…  Nevertheless, the UN believes they have an opening to intervene in our country's affairs. The United Nations delivered a formal stand down order to the Trump administration this week, ordering the President to stop Federal officers from using non-lethal force against peaceful protesters in Portland.  This is how the UN uses the taxd ollars we send them… Against us!  Don't let the Democrats and GOP cowards get away with restoring the UN's funding! Please, send your instant FaxBlast to Congress before it's too late and force them to kill the funding increase and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act instead!  “Peaceful demonstrations that have been taking place in cities in the US, such as Portland, really must be able to continue without those participating in them… risking arbitrary arrest or detention, being subject to unnecessary, disproportionate or discriminatory use of force, or suffering other violations of their rights, proclaimed the UN Human Rights Office's spokesperson.  The UN delivered a formal stand down order to the Trump administration, warning that there would be consequences if Federal officers continued enforcing Federal law…  The City of Portland has also ordered the federal officers that Trump sent in to remove the protective fence that had been erected around the federal courthouse. They are trying to get a judge to block the officers from using any non-lethal weapons and they want to remove the fencing so that the mob can have unrestricted access to the building.  In case you haven't been paying attention, Porttland, Oregon has seen almost 60 straight days of unrest. The mainstream media calls them protests, but they are more aptly described as riots. For three weeks, these rioters have been trying to burn down the federal courthouse in their city.  Rioters broke the glass windows and tossed lit explosives into the building, in an attempt to burn it down. That is when President Trump and Attorney General Barr ordered federal officers in to protect the building and its workers.  For three weeks, there have been nightly standoffs between officers and rioters. Every night, the rioters try to kill the officers and burn down the courthouse. But come sunrise, the courthouse is still standing and more ANTIFA goons are behind bars facing federal charges.  The mainstream media doesn't report any of this. Instead, they are claiming that federal agents are kidnapping people. That's right, even though these people get charged and arraigned, the mainstream media is calling them kidnappings instead of arrests…  Did you know that the other night, the ANTIFA mob trapped federal officers inside the courthouse, barricaded the door, and then tried to burn the building down with them all inside? Did you know that dozens of officers have been injured after peaceful protesters lobbed explosives at them and shined lasers in their eyes potentially permanently blinding the officers? Did you know that every single rioter has been arrested has been charged with a crime, read their rights, brought before a judge, and arraigned?  The image above shows a federal officer, armed with only a paintball gun, being hit by an explosive fired at him by the rioters…  And yet, the UN calls this a violation of the rioters' human rights. Not only are they ordering Trump to end all law enforcement efforts in Portland, but they are threatening action and, yes, even an intervention if the President continues to allow officers to use tear gas against the mob.  This is what your taxes are paying for. Once you average out our annual donation to the UN, the average American taxpayer ends up sending approximately 50d ollars to the United Nations every single year. And this is what we have to show for it…  Don't let the Democrats and GOP cowards get away with restoring the UN's funding! Please, send your instant FaxBlast to Congress before it's too late and force them to kill the funding increase and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act instead!  Here is the good news: The UN has not received its funding yet. While House Democrats are hell-bent on increasing the United States' contribution to the United Nations by removing the cuts that Trump has made, their bill has not become law yet.  There is still time to stop it!  The UN literally has their employees on the ground working with the protesters trying to kill these officers and burn down the courthouse. The UN has already put out a release saying that they stand with Antifa they deleted the tweet after people started condemning them for it.  This is why the United Nations CANNOT receive even a cent of Federal funding!  We are calling all Conservatives to band together and send an instant FaxBlast to Congress right now demanding that they kill the Left's UN funding increase and, instead, pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act, a bill that would pull the plug on UN funding once and for all!  Please, join the fight and stop the UN from being re-funded before it's too late!  Don't let the Democrats and GOP cowards get away with restoring the UN's funding! Please, you must send your instant FaxBlast to Congress before it's too late and force them to kill the funding increase and pass the American Sovereignty Restoration Act instead!  Sincerely,  Max McGuire  Advocacy Director  Conservative Daily",false
55b36510,"Coroner Saying George Floyd Died of Drug Overdose, Not Police Brutality ⋆ The Washington Sentinel","The leftist Democrat Gov. of Oregon, Kate Brown, issued an astounding lie blaming Trump for the murder of a Trump supporter by an Antifa terrorist.  Brown issued her truth-free comment on Saturday, August 29, claiming that it is Trump who is responsible for the tens of thousands of Antifa and Black Lives terrorists burning and looting America’s cities and killing people from coast t coast.  Are liberal voter really so stupid as to believe this garbage?  For the last several years, and escalating in recent months, President Trump has encouraged division and stoked violence. It happened in Charlottesville. It happened in Kenosha. And now, unfortunately, it is happening in Portland, Oregon,” she exclaimed in her Saturday comment  “But despite the President’s jeers and tweets, this is a matter of life and death,” she added.  Yeah. Death dealt by Antifa and Black Lives Matter terrorists. Not a single person has died or even been injured by the federal operatives Trump has sent to various Democrat-controlled cities. On the other had, more than 30 people have died across the country at the hands of Antifa, Black Lives Matter, and Democrat rioters and looters.  “Whether it’s his completely incompetent response to the pandemic, where nearly 200,000 have died, or his outright encouragement of violence in our streets: it should be clear to everyone by now that no one is truly safe with Donald Trump as President,” she said.  This is, of course, all a lie. Trump has never “outright encouraged violence in the streets.” Not only that, but 200,000 people have not died from COVID in the U.S.A. The official number is 183,000 but a large number of those are false reports based on assumptions, instead of facts.  The CDC recently sheepishly noted that only six percent of the deaths recorded as COVID were actually caused by COVID.  CDC: For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditions or causes in addition to COVID-19, on average, there were 2.6 additional conditions or causes per death. — Phil Kerpen @kerpen August 6, 2020  Next Brown tried to blame the riots on righties who oppose her draconian coronavirus lockdowns.  “Throughout this pandemic, whether it was demonstrations protesting my COVID-19 executive orders, or large crowds marching for the cause of Black Lives Matter to call for police reform, I have supported the rights of all Oregonians to peacefully protest,” she wrote.  Seriously? Does anyone believe that it is right-leaning COVID-scoffers are the reason Brown’s cities are burning?  Is ANYONE dumb enough to believe that?  Then she excused her leftist protesters and praised them as simply wonderful human beings.  “For months this summer, we have seen powerful images of Oregonians uniting for the cause of racial justice, calling for justice for Black men and women who have been killed by police violence. We remember them, we say their names. George Floyd. Breonna Taylor. Ahmaud Arbery. Philando Castile. Alton Sterling. And far too many other Black lives taken by racist violence.”  Moron, THESE are the people who are burning down your cities.  “For weeks, we have also seen small groups of demonstrators from all ends of the political spectrum who are intent on committing acts of vandalism and violence,” she conclued. “Tragically, yesterday a life was lost in downtown Portland. We do not yet know the full circumstances of this person’s death. Regardless, a life has been lost, and our hearts go out to this person’s family. We will find those who were responsible, and they will be held accountable.”  Are Democrat voters really stupid enough to believe these lies?

cda94a74,Biden to Send $3 Trillion on Plane to Iran as Apology for Soleimani Assassination,"Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barak Hussein Obama, Joe Biden is preparing to cower to the Iranian Caliphate in the form of a $3 trillion apology for the Trump administration’s assassination of their top General, Qassem Soleimani.  While the assassination was celebrated by democracies worldwide, Democrats in the US accused Trump of showboating, resulting in raised tensions with the Muslim country.  The continuous funneling of cash from US taxpayers to Iran between the Obama, and now Biden administrations, is shameful. While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.  This is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.  The jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range 5,950 nautical miles, a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.  With the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”  Due to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.  Sullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.  He is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.  The offer of cash as an apology only serves to lessen our standing in the world. The only silver lining here is that it is being delivered by the best America has to offer.",false

Latest: 'This Investigation is a Sham': Judicial Watch President Slams John Durham for Going Easy on the Deep State  At the same time, Ohio is taking measures to create isolation camps with assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA that can house COVID-19 patients in certain instances.  take our poll - story continues below  Did Kyle Rittenhouse act in self defense?

Ohio Department of Health ODH Interim Director Lance Himes issued a state-wide order on Aug. 31 enacting these camps to house people who “are unable to safely self-quarantine in their place of residence and to isolate those diagnosed with or showing symptoms of COVID-19.”  The Ohio camps will be used to house people who “test positive for COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization but need isolation including those exiting from hospitals; those who have been exposed to COVID-19 who do not require hospitalization; and asymptomatic high-risk individuals needing social distancing as a precautionary measure.”  Dan Tierney, who works as the press secretary to Ohio’s Republican Governor Mike DeWine, downplayed any worries about the FEMA camps being erected throughout the state.  “The order gives the state of Ohio the ability to draw down federal funding to reimburse the local EMA and health department when a non-congregate shelter is needed. These shelters are used when an individual is unable to safely quarantine or isolate in their home,” he said during a press conference.  “The nature of these shelters is no different than what the EMA and others stand-up during natural disasters. The intent of the order is to provide a safe and healthy space for the individual who needs to be quarantined or isolated as determined by local needs. This also helps protect family members from exposure. FEMA has FAQ’s and more information available,” Tierney continued.  “As determined by local needs’ remains ambiguous as an answer to the question of who decides whether a person’s residence is safe,” he added.  Big League Politics has reported on the previously unfathomable abuses that are being introduced to society due to COVID-19 mass hysteria:  A so-called medical expert, drunk off power due because of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, is now suggesting “morality pills” for the public to stop them from resisting their top-down mandates. Parker Crutchfield, who works as the Associate Professor of Medical Ethics, Humanities and Law at Western Michigan University, made the suggestion in an op/ed published in The Conversation. “When someone chooses not to follow public health guidelines around the coronavirus, they’re defecting from the public good,” Crutchfield writes. He is proposing a solution to drug society so that individuals will no longer have the freedom of choice and be at the mercy of the whims of whoever is in power. “Could a psychoactive pill be the solution to the pandemic? It’s a far-out proposal that’s bound to be controversial, but one I believe is worth at least considering, given the importance of social cooperation in the struggle to get COVID-19 under control,” Crutchfield writes. He uses “experimental economics” to justify his highly invasive solution that is something out of “Brave New World.” “Moral enhancement is the use of substances to make you more moral. The psychoactive substances act on your ability to reason about what the right thing to do is, or your ability to be empathetic or altruistic or cooperative,” Crutchfield writes. He brings up heinous abuses that the government has performed in the past to justify new abuses in the current age. “The scenario in which the government forces an immunity booster upon everyone is plausible. And the military has been forcing enhancements like vaccines or “uppers” upon soldiers for a long time,” Crutchfield writes.  Like after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, these emergency actions taken during the crisis could be made permanent. The era of the globalist pandemic has arrived, and human liberty is in grave danger as a result.",false
95a7443d,Biden Plans to Move Social Security Eligibility Age to 75,"It’s unknown why Democrats hate our senior citizens so much. After all, they are the greatest generation that built this country into the earthly paradise that it is today, with all the freedoms and benefits that every citizen now enjoys such as paid leave and healthcare.  The latest evidence of this comes from their proposal to “reform Social Security,” as they put it. However, simple reform is deceiving when describing what they propose to do. They don’t want to change the way we manage the funds or how they are delivered. Democrats just want to screw senior citizens and delay their retirement years and not just buy a couple of years either. No, the new policy is proposing to raise eligibility for Social Security by a decade, from the present 65 years old, to a whopping 75 years old.  Biden explained the proposal in an internal memo that has been leaked to us:  “Social Security is not sustainable. Either party will tell you this. Something radical has to be done, with the only other option being to just eliminate it. There’s absolutely no reason why the elderly cannot work a little longer. None. Look at me. I’m still working. You don’t see me complaining about it like a whiny baby. So they’ll work longer and they’ll do it with smiles on their faces or those old coots can live in the street. It’s time to suffer for the good of the economy! Like me, Joe Biden. I’m running for President Of The United States Of America! I bet your hair smells great!”  You can now see how Democrats feel about their fellow Americans. No other party in the history of America has ever suggested sacrificing our seniors’ well-being for the good of the economy.",false
32da86fa,Study Concludes Mask Wearers Have Lower IQ,"According to the latest study by the Dunning-Kruger Institute, people who subscribe to the notion that masks will protect them have a lower IQ.  The study was conducted by none other than Dr. Joe Barron, Director of the Dunning-Kruger Institute.  Below is an excerpt of the results of the study:  “After an intense three month study, we have found conclusive evidence that people that wear masks have a lower IQ. This was clearly demonstrated in all of our studies. In the first of these studies, we took mask wearers and anti-maskers. The maskers scored much lower in the IQ test portion. This test measures their idiot quotient. The anti-maskers, on the other hand, scored much hire in this measure. In one of our other studies, we tested the basic science knowledge of maskers and anti-maskers. On average, anti-maskers believed that the earth is flat, vaccines cause autism, and that 5G causes homosexuality. They also believed that masks could somehow block oxygen and trap CO2 inside of the mask, while simultaneously allowing a virus to permeate the mask. This is literally impossible as molecules of oxygen and CO2 are much smaller than viral droplets. Maksers seemed to grasp simple scientific principles. They also understood the simple facts about masks. They understood that oxygen and CO2 molecules are small enough to permeate through the mask while droplets containing the virus could not easily pass through the mask. Between these two studies and countless others we performed, we are confident in our conclusion that mask wearers have a lower IQ, or idiot quotient.”  This proves what us patriots already know. Those stupid communist maskers never read articles and they don’t know what they are talking about.  Masks cause CO2 poisoning and communism.  These people are against science, logic, and the American way of life.",false
a3ce9ec1,Tragedy in Nigeria as hundreds of Catholics found burnt alive by Muslims,"Home » Africa, Breaking News, Crimes, Extinction » Tragedy in Nigeria as hundreds of Catholics found burnt alive by Muslims  This is a brutal example of how far the struggle between Muslims and Catholics in Nigeria has reached.  Muslims are determined to impose their ‘religion’ all over Africa as well as in other continents and countries of the world. Islam has but one goal: rule the world at any cost!  And where are the International Human Rights Organizations? Christians are burnt alive in Nigeria: a horrific Holocaust right in front of International indifference! As denounced by Father Juan Carlos Martos, on behalf of the Missionari Clarettiani, via del Sacro Cuore di Maria, Rome, Italy.  By publishing this graphic document on Facebook, I have intended to make the world aware of certain terrible events totally ignored or minimized by the mainstream media; an authentic genocide so cruel and inhuman only comparable with the most hateful and vile acts in the Nazi extermination camps.  To my great surprise, Facebook has criticized me for the publication of this graphic document as a proof of the Holocaust that Christians have been suffering in Nigeria in the last ten years. According to Facebook’s Security policy of the ‘social’ Network, this photo has been classified as ‘pornographic’, ‘violent’ or ‘inappropriate’ and hence I was disallowed to publish any picture for a week. And I was threatened drastic measures if I insist publishing any document that prove the terrible violations of Human Rights in Nigeria. This attitude by the Spanish Facebook Management is an attack to the freedom of expression as much as a shameful insult to the 500 victims only in this horrible episode slaughtered by Islamic terror only for being christian.  I thought that this social network, originated in the United States , would not bend its knees in front of terror.  Especially, when still healing their wounds suffered in the gruesome 9/11 attack, just as our own 3/11 at Madrid railway station, all innocent victims of the wild fury and insanity of Islamic terror.  This seems even more unacceptable in Spain, a Democratic state, where the rights of opinion, expression and religion are guaranteed by the Constitution Art. 16 and 20, if there is an attempt to limit such rights, let alone through threats and coercion thus weakening their freedom of expression by condemning as “inappropriate” a graphic document not a photomontage which reflects a brutal reality in all its crudeness.  Contrarily, the Administrators of Facebook Spain should welcome this public protest advocating that such a barbarian act will never be replicated and that its perpetrators will be brought to justice. This is a right and duty of every citizen: a service to society, ultimate goal, I feel, of any network that defines itself as ‘social’.  Regrettably, if the murders continue, this is greatly because truth is always hidden to the sovereign people, so that they may not be aware and ‘disdained’ by it: complicit silence by the mainstream media leads to the indifference of the international political community facing this unspeakable Holocaust! Let alone the cowardice already rooted in the western world facing the Islamic terror. A consequence of the stupid ” Alliance of civilizations”: another regrettable incident of our former Prime Minister Rodriguez Zapatero.  Can you imagine the reaction of the Islamic terrorist organization in the impossible case of a massacre of Muslims in a mosque, by the hands of christian terrorists? And how widely would our media cover and condemn the crime and the criminals??  Therefore, from this modest blog, I ask a favor from all people who are reading me: please distribute this photo and its comments using all the media you have. If only for commemorating these martyrs since, unfortunately, Facebook seems to be on the side of the executioners by preventing the publication of such tragic events.  Statement by Father Juan Carlos Martos cmf Secretariat of PV Clarettiani Missionaries  Note: There has been a lot of discussion about the photo of this article in many places of the internet. Please note that the generic photo used in this article is NOT actually from this Catholic tragedy but from a different tragedy an oil tanker blowing up as we do not have a photo of this Catholic tragedy. To be taken into consideration only as a generic photo and not from the actual event. If anyone owns a photo from this tragic event, please send it to us.  Please wait...

Our commitment to investing in our armed forces is at the heart of the leading role the UK takes in NATO – whether it is sending Typhoons to the Baltic Air Policing Mission or taking part in training exercises in Eastern Europe, the UK has the capability to play its part. As one of only 4 countries to have met the NATO target to spend 2 per cent of our GDP on defence, we will be urging our allies to follow suit, with this clear message: in an unstable world, when you have multiple events unfolding – be it the Russia-Ukraine crisis, war in Syria, or the situation in Iraq – we need to be ready for any eventuality, and ready together.",other
e7a805a6,Pelosi Defers $2.2 Billion From Social Security to Cuomo’s Budget,"Since the outbreak of the deadly pandemic crisis that’s been running rampant in the United States, Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York has been taking every opportunity he can to overshadow *President Trump and add his “expertise” to the conversation. His constant, daily beseeching of aid for his especially-hard-hit state has become rote. And now his friend Speaker Nancy Pelosi is handing out a favor.  Pelosi is no stranger to pillaging our social security money in fictional satire articles. Even though it is literally impossible for her to do such a thing, the intellectually-troubled Trump supporting crowd will shoot up and spill their colostomy bags all over themselves to excoriate her about it every time because the Homestyle Buffet is still closed and the repeats of Big Bang Theory are finally becoming annoying. Old people can’t understand jokes about Ray Palmer having a tiny dick.  Sandy Batt of New York’s Hey I’m Walkin’ Here magazine wrote a short essay on the Empire State and it’s treatment:  “On 9/11, New York had the sympathy of the whole country and the solidarity of US against those who wanted to destroy us. Now that Trump is in the White House, suddenly the pretend patriots who run under his shorts sniffing his balls don’t care. As long as the pandemic hasn’t reached Cousinhumper, Kentucky, they figure, Jesus will handle it. If you needed any more proof that Trump is the worst *President in history, he’s basically encouraged his traitorous followers to split back to the Civil War battle lines. That takes full on seditionist work. You know, it almost makes it okay if Pelosi COULD take that money. They deserve to lap up Alpo in their trailers.”  The fictional billions that the Speaker is functionally transferring will help shore up necessary aid and projects in New York, which is the number one state contributing to America’s tax base. Trumpers would do well to remember that blue States and Democrats provide them with aid when they take too much oxy and need reviving drugs or get hit with a hurricane and need a place to stay, eat, and remain safe. They’ll be thanking future President Cuomo.  *Impeached",false
fcf3c79b,"Coronavirus: Mouthwash could prevent transmission, report says","Mouthwash has the potential to protect against COVID-19 infection by killing the coronavirus before it can infect human cells, according to a new report.  Coronaviruses belong to the class of 'enveloped viruses', meaning they are covered by a fatty layer that is vulnerable to certain chemicals.  A team of international researchers say mouthwash could destroy the outermost layer or 'envelope' of the virus, preventing its replication in the mouth and throat.  The scientists say there is an urgent need to test the effectiveness of mouthwash in trials, although there is currently no clinical evidence that it would be successful.  The World Health Organisation has already said: 'There is no evidence that using mouthwash will protect you from infection with the new coronavirus.'  The study authors do not say that current commercially-available mouthwash prevents COVID-19, but that further research into mouthwash chemicals could be beneficial.  Readily available dental mouthwashes have the potential to destroy the lipid envelope of coronaviruses, combating virus replication in the mouth and throat  Writing in Function, the study authors, led by Cardiff University, say oral rinses are an ‘under-researched area of major clinical need’.  The team is backed by virologists, lipid specialists and healthcare experts from Cardiff University’s School of Medicine, along with the universities of Nottingham, Colorado, Ottawa, Barcelona and Cambridge’s Babraham Institute.  'Safe use of mouthwash – as in gargling – has so far not been considered by public health bodies in the UK,' said lead author Professor O’Donnell, co-director of Cardiff University’s Systems Immunity Research Institute.  'In test tube experiments and limited clinical studies, some mouthwashes contain enough of known virucidal ingredients to effectively target lipids in similar enveloped viruses.  'What we don’t know yet is whether existing mouthwashes are active against the lipid membrane of SARS-CoV-2.  'Our review of the literature suggests that research is needed as a matter of urgency to determine its potential for use against this new virus.'  'This is an under-researched area of major clinical need – and we hope that research projects will be quickly mobilised to further evaluate this.'  Coronavirus is a type of enveloped virus, meaning it has an outer lipid membrane that could be damaged by chemicals in mouthwash. Naked viruses lack the viral envelope  The ingredients of dental mouthwashes, including chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, hydrogen peroxide and povidone-iodine, all have the potential to prevent infection and several ‘deserve clinical evaluation’, according to the researchers.  In particular, these chemicals disrupt the outer lipid membrane, known as the ‘viral envelope’ or ‘lipid envelope’ of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.  The lipid envelope helps several viruses, including coronaviruses, bind to human cells while avoiding the host immune system.  Specific spike proteins called ‘glycoproteins’ on the surface of the envelope identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's cell membrane, which allows infection.  Mouthwash chemicals could potentially modify the ability of the spike glycoproteins to interact with receptors on host cells.  The researchers said there had so far been 'no discussion' about the potential role of damaging the fatty membrane as a possible way to inactivate the virus.  The lipid envelope does not change when viruses mutate, meaning mouthwash could still work against any new coronavirus strains that emerge from this pandemic.  The WHO has previously debunked the suggestion that mouthwash can prevent infection by SARS CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.  'Some brands of mousthwash can eliminate certain microbes for a few minutes in the saliva in your mouth,' it said.  'However, this does not mean they protect you from 2019-nCoV infection.'  WHO has emphatically debunked the theory that gargling mouthwash can prevent infection by the coronavirus  Research in this area appears to be largely unexplored – Listerine, one of the biggest mouthwash brands, says on its website that none of its products have been tested against any strains of coronavirus.  'Listerine mouthwash is not intended to be used, nor would it be beneficial as a hand sanitizer or surface disinfectant,' it says.  Common mouthwashes contain the same key ingredient as coronavirus-killing hand santiser – alcohol.  However, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US's public health authority, recommends a hand sanitiser that contains at least 60 per cent alcohol for effective protection, and Listerine's products consist of only around 20 per cent alcohol.  The World Health Organisation WHO also stresses that drinking pure alcohol, along with methanol or bleach, is incredibly dangerous.  These substances do not prevent or cure COVID-19 and can lead to disability and death.  'Methanol, ethanol, and bleach are sometimes used in cleaning products to kill the virus on surfaces – however you should never drink them,' WHO says on its website.  'They will not kill the virus in your body and they will harm your internal organs.'",false

Wilkerson, is now urging the U.S. military to recall Michael Flynn and put him on military trial for sedition. It’s the latest reminder that Donald Trump’s pardons aren’t magic wands, and the legal pushback against Trump and his co-conspirators is just beginning. With the public this thoroughly outraged, there’s simply no way prosecutors will sit on their hands. They’ll pursue every possible method of overthrowing or working around Trump’s pardons. Bet on it.  Lost in the headlines tonight is the fact that Donald Trump pardoned one of Rand Paul’s allies, which may help explain why Rand Paul has been such a Trump cheerleader this past year. Come to think of it, Rand Paul’s vote to acquit Trump during his impeachment trial should be viewed in hindsight as a quid pro quo, and Rand Paul should be criminally prosecuted accordingly.

The nation-wide halt was requested after two babies died minutes after receiving the MMR vaccination on July 6.  The babies were rushed to Safotu Hospital in Savai'i but couldn't be saved.  Both the one-year-old girl and boy were killed within minutes of getting the injection stock image  The first baby, a one-year-old girl, died within three minutes of being injected with the vaccine, TV1 Samoa reported.  Two hours later, a second family brought in their one-year-old boy to be vaccinated, but refused to go through with it after hearing about the earlier death.  The nurse allegedly injected the boy without the parents' consent and he died within one minute.  ABOUT THE MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA SHOT According to the World Health Organisation, countries that use vaccines have almost entirely eradicated diseases such as measles  The MMR vaccine protects against the three diseases of mumps, measles and rubella  It is usually injected in two doses in young children  One injection is about 93% effective, while the two doses are 97% effective at preventing diseases  Child mortality has gone down in many countries that use the vaccines Advertisement  An immediate withdrawal of the vaccine was ordered by Ministry of Health CEO Dr Take Naseri.  A forensic autopsy on the two babies has also been requested. Their deaths are being investigated by police.  Prime Minister Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Dr. Sailele Malielegaoi expressed his condolences to the families via Facebook.  'There are already processes that will determine if negligence is a factor. And if so, rest assured those processes will be implemented to the letter to ensure that such a tragedy will not be repeated and those responsible will be made to answer,' he said.

e14592c0,White Men Have Committed More Mass Shootings than Any Other Group,"The deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was shocking in its scale — but it wasn't a surprise that it was committed by a white male.  Statistics show that since 1982, the majority of mass shootings — 54 percent — were committed by white men, according to data from Mother Jones. Black people were the second largest perpetrators of mass shootings based on ethnic background, but only accounted for roughly 16 percent of the total incidents during the same time period.  The average age of the shooters was 35, however, making the perpetrator in Las Vegas, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, somewhat of an outlier. It is too early to say if mental illness played a role in Paddock's case, but it has in a number of mass shootings, though it is perhaps too frequently pointed to as the primary cause.  Other research suggests white men commit mass shootings out of a sense of entitlement. James Holmes, for example, had failed out of his PhD program when he opened fire in a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. Dylann Roof was unemployed when he gunned down nine people at the end of a prayer service in a Charteston, South Carolina church.  There's a feeling of entitlement that white men have that black men don't, criminologist James Alan Fox told The Washington Post in 2012. They often complain that their job was taken by blacks or Mexicans or Jews. They feel that a well-paid job is their birthright. It's a blow to their psyche when they lose that. . . . If you're a member of a group that hasn't historically experienced unemployment, there's a far greater stigma to [losing a job] than those who have.  But others say it's hard to point to any single factor in terms of why white men have comitted most mass shootings.  There are pieces of the puzzle, and you put them all on the jigsaw board, and you're still going to have a big hole there. What I do know is that violent behavior — whether it's serious violence or minor violence in populations — is never just one thing. It's not a one thing problem. It's going to be an accumulation of things, kind of a whole cocktail of factors, Jeffrey Swanson, professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University, told CNN after the Charleston shooting. Newsweek subscription offers >  The high number of white men committing mass shootings is also explained, at least in part, by the fact white people make up a majority of the U.S. population 63 percent and men are more likely to commit violent crime in general: In the U.S., 98 percent of mass shootings and 90 percent of all murders are committed by men.

The kid-size clubhouse will come with several varieties of spray paint so kids can tag the tiny building with their own empowering slogans. It will also be made out of cardboard, allowing the cute little tikes to burn the whole thing down if their demands are not met.  Here at Fisher-Price, we are steadfastly committed to social justice, said toy designer Camden Flufferton. We need to teach our kids what democracy looks like, and there's no better example of democracy in action than violent vandalism and arson. We hope this new playset will serve as an inspiration for parents wanting to teach their kids how to threaten citizens with violence whenever their demands are not met.  The set will also come with toy televisions, cell phones, jewelry, and clothing, allowing kids to simulate looting before they torch the entire set. The set will be available in stores for $399 because of capitalism.  Experts are questioning the wisdom of this move by Fisher-Price, mainly because people in the target market don't typically have any kids. We know we'll probably only sell, like, 3 of these, said Flufferton, but selling them isn't the point. We just need you to know we're on the right side of history.

7eea4e9f,"Donald Trump blames 'anti-American riots' for unrest in Kenosha, doesn't focus on Blake or Rittenhouse shootings","Donald Trump blames 'anti-American riots' for unrest in Kenosha, doesn't focus on Blake or Rittenhouse shootings  KENOSHA - President Donald Trump on Tuesday rolled into this city shaken by shootings, death and unrest, hailing law enforcement for quelling disturbances but offering little to those seeking justice for Jacob Blake.  During a tour of the city and a roundtable discussion at Bradford High School, Trump declared victory in Wisconsin and said that the federal government can help other communities that face strife, including Portland, Oregon.  Kenosha has been ravaged by anti-police and anti-American riots,” the president said as photos of the destruction in the city were displayed behind the group.  But he did not want to address what sparked protests that gave way to the destruction, refusing to answer whether he believed systemic racism was a problem in the United States. Instead, he suggested some police forces are being unfairly criticized for simply choking.  When you see they have made allegations they must be fully and fairly investigated ... but you can do an incredible job for years and then you have one bad apple or something bad that happens that's bad and that's the nightly news for three weeks, Trump said.  When that happens, “they’re either dead or they’re in big trouble. People have to understand that. They choke sometimes, Trump said at a table with the Kenosha police chief and Kenosha County sheriff just days after a white city police officer shot Blake, a Black man, in the back seven times.  Asked about what he would say to Blake, Trump said: I feel terribly for anybody who goes through that. As you know it's under investigation. It's a big thing happening right now ... I hope they come up with the right answer. It's a complicated answer.  During remarks, Trump said, I really came today to thank law enforcement. Really, what you have done has been incredible, it has been really inspiring.  Trump brought with him to Kenosha U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr and Homeland Security director Chad Wolf to announce efforts to respond to the unrest.  Trump said he will send $42 million to Wisconsin to rebuild from the unrest, including $4 million for Kenosha businesses that experienced damage and more money to prosecute crimes.  Just ahead of Trump's visit, Gov. Tony Evers announced he and the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. would make available up to $1 million worth of interest-free loans for damaged businesses in Kenosha.  Trump visits torched businesses  Trump's first stop in Kenosha was to B&L Office Furniture, which was torched by violent protesters after Blake was shot.  We're going to work with you, Trump told John Rode, who owns the Rode's Camera Shop building a few streets over, also destroyed last week.  We're going to help you rebuild. It's a great area, it's a great state. A thing like this should never happen. They have to call early, Trump said.  Rode, who sold his family's camera shop to new owners in 2008, joined the president after the current owners of the business itself declined to appear with the president on his tour Tuesday.  I said no, thank you — I didn't want anything to do with President Trump, co-owner Paul Willette told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. If it were any other president I would, but not this one. I can't begin to describe my frustration with him. I politely declined coming down there. I didn't want to be part of that fiasco.  Rode credited Trump for bringing federal troops to Kenosha to calm the area, though the soldiers in Kenosha are National Guard members under the direction of state officials.  I just appreciate President Trump coming today; everybody here does, Rode told reporters after meeting with Trump in the rubble of the furniture business.  Kenosha erupted last week with rage on Aug. 23 after Blake's shooting.  During the third night of protests and violence, a 17-year-old, Kyle Rittenhouse from Antioch, Illinois, brought an assault-style rifle to Kenosha's downtown and allegedly shot three people and killed two of them. He is charged with six crimes as a result of the incident, including first-degree intentional homicide.  During the president's tour of the city, Kenosha Police Chief Daniel Miskinis said what transpired here was an attack on America, but it's unclear whether he included the deadly shooting in that assessment.  By coming to Kenosha, the president entered a potentially fraught situation. Evers and other top Democrats asked him to put off the trip to allow the city to heal.  But the president pressed ahead, landing in Waukegan, Illinois, and arriving by motorcade in Kenosha.  Thousands of people lined the streets on his route, many expressing their support for the president by waving American flags and Trump campaign signs. Others waved their middle finger and held signs of opposition. One sign read you're not helping.  He surveyed some damage in Kenosha before going to Bradford High School, where a makeshift command post has been established.  The high school cafeteria was full of law enforcement and National Guard members. The group had collected items from protesters and placed them in the middle of the room as a display.  There are still more than 1,500 National Guard personnel in the city, and a curfew is in place.  U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson told Trump that his response calling Evers to facilitate more National Guard troops ought to be a model for calming riots elsewhere in the country.  All you have to do is ask and we’ll be there literally within minutes, Trump responded.  But throughout the visit, Trump and Wisconsin Republicans accompanying him made statements that would mislead the public into believing it was Trump that authorized the National Guard forces.  Such a mobilization is under Gov. Tony Evers' and other governors' authority.  Blake's family held their own event nearby and said Trump emboldened police to take aggressive and sometimes deadly action against Black Americans by defending Rittenhouse.  RELATED: Witnesses describe the night Kyle Rittenhouse opened fire during protests after the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha  That’s the language that got us here, Justin Blake, Jacob Blake's uncle, said of Trump's comments. That’s the language that fed police officers all around this country the belief that they could attack young, unarmed Black men and shoot them in the back seven times. And that’s why I’m not directing anything toward that gentleman today, and I use that term loosely.  U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan criticized Trump for failing to condemn the actions of Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen.  What we need right now are messages of healing, of uniting people, of bringing people together. I hope that the president finds that capability today. But his rhetoric up to this point has not been about healing, Pocan said ahead of Trump's visit.  Biden deputy campaign manager and communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement, Trump failed once again to meet the moment, refusing to utter the words that Wisconsinites and Americans across the country needed to hear today from the president: a condemnation of violence of all kinds, no matter who commits it.  Outside Bradford High School, hundreds of Trump supporters and opponents intermingled on sidewalks and parking lots. Don’t arrest us, arrest the police, one group chanted as others waved Trump flags.  The president refused to answer whether he thought systemic racism was a problem in the country, saying reporters should instead focus on the destruction people angry about it have committed.  I think peaceful protesting is fantastic, it's great, Trump said. But by and large this is not peaceful protesting. When you walk into an area, you see buildings that have been burned down. Fortunately, here we stopped it earlier.  Later, he said there are people who want change, including those who want to see law and order.  You don't see them marching, you don't see them on the streets, but what they want is a great police force, people that are going to keep them safe where their houses aren't broken into, where they're not raped and murdered, he said.  Barr on Tuesday claimed federal law enforcement dispatched to Chicago picked up information that these violent instigators were coming to Kenosha. They were coming from California, Washington state, a lot from Chicago.  He said law enforcement expected matters to get worse, and added the looting and the arson were unacceptable.  Trump emphasized the use of the National Guard to stop the disturbances in Kenosha and he kept up criticism against Evers, who he said rejected an offer of federal help, only to turn around a day later and accept the offer.  But he also said Evers was better than most Democratic leaders by working with Trump after the deadly shooting on Tuesday.  Blake was shot when officers responded to a police call alleging Blake was not supposed to be at a residence in the area. Blake was shot trying to get into a vehicle outside the residence.  Police found a knife on the floorboard of the vehicle, but it's unknown whether officers knew Blake had the knife before one shot him.  According to an update released Tuesday by the Department of Justice, the DOJ's Department of Criminal Investigation, along with the FBI, have so far conducted 88 interviews, collected 102 evidence items, downloaded 28 videos and issued four search warrants.  Patrick Marley and Mary Spicuzza of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel contributed to this report.  Editor's note, Sept. 1, 10:30 p.m.: This story has been updated. John Rode owns the building where Rode's Camera Shop was located, but no longer owns the business. Trump did not visit the former camera shop",false
db426e5c,Chairman Mackowiak supports Gov.

Even the Austin Police Association is expressing discomfort with the idea, which allows camping on sidewalks, alleyways, and other public places except parks and City Hall, which includes in front of your house, provided the people camping are not making the sidewalk unreasonably inconvenient or hazardous.

Sessions was in Milwaukee for the announcement  Bringing his law and order message to Milwaukee, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Monday he's assigning two more prosecutors to the U.S. attorney's office here to focus on violent crime.  Sessions spoke to federal and local law enforcement members at the federal courthouse, where earlier this month a federal-local task force announced charges in a major drug bust linked to dozens of overdose deaths in southeast Wisconsin. He did not take questions.  Sessions cited statistics pointing to an uptick in violent crime in the U.S. in recent years and highlighted prominent local homicide cases, including the murder of a pizza delivery driver and the fatal shooting of a pregnant woman.  Sadly, this beautiful city has not been immune to these problems, Sessions said.  For the past two years, Milwaukee has struggled with high rates of homicide — a similar spike was seen in Chicago, Baltimore and St. Louis — though the number of killings is trending down this year.  Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said the department will record decreases this year in virtually every single crime category compared with last year, but crime is still too high.  He called Sessions' announcement significant.  We recognize we generate far more arrests than can be handled by the courts as it is, but obviously having the federal venue for our more serious offenders, particularly gun offenders, is very promising, Flynn said.  Outside the courthouse, demonstrators protested Sessions and criticized changes he made to police reform programs, including the collaborative reform process that was underway in Milwaukee under the previous presidential administration.  It's a farce to say he cares about preventing violence, said State Rep. David Bowen D-Milwaukee.  If he was truly committed, he would start with making sure we have a Police Department that had great community relations with the people they serve, treating people with dignity and respect, he said.  Sessions has changed the reform program to focus on sharing crime prevention tips. No final report on the Milwaukee Police Department has been released, but a draft has been used as a starting point for residents, city officials and police leaders for reform efforts.  RELATED: How residents would reform the Milwaukee Police Department  RELATED: City officials, including Chief Edward Flynn, pledge to move forward on draft DOJ reforms  RELATED: DOJ draft report: Trust damaged between Milwaukee police, community  Sessions has been traveling to different cities to discuss violent crime and is scheduled to appear in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday.  Last week, he held a news conference in Baltimore focused on illegal immigration and international gangs. Days later, he assigned three additional federal prosecutors to that region, the Baltimore Sun reported.  Sessions' visit to Milwaukee comes weeks after the city's Police Department hosted other U.S. Department of Justice officials and New Orleans police for training about how Milwaukee police used a federal program to cut crime.  RELATED: Milwaukee police did something different to tackle crime in the city — they focused on just 2.3 square miles of it  Beginning in March 2016, the Milwaukee Police Department, the FBI and other federal partners focused on 2.3 square miles on the north side known as the Center Street Corridor. Police statistics had shown 10% of all violent crime in the city occurred in that area.  The program, known as the Public Safety Partnership, brought a local law enforcement priority to the forefront of the federal agencies and resulted in a dramatic drop in nonfatal shootings in that area in 2016, officials said.  Authorities said after the initial success in 2016, the department backed off too soon and crime began to re-emerge in the targeted area.  Sessions also came to Wisconsin this summer to address the opioid crisis. The attorney general said drugs are destroying and bankrupting families nationwide during a speech at the annual conference of the National Alliance for Drug Endangered Children.",partially false

The more time people spent on activities such as gardening, walking briskly or dancing, the lower their chances of dying within the period, researchers found. Vigorous exercise such as running or playing sport appeared to bring even greater benefits.

bd762254,President Trump Files Two Lawsuits Against Dirty Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger for Leaking Confidential Litigation Call,"The travesty in Georgia continues. President Trump held a one-hour long phone call on Saturday with crooked Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and state election officials on the 2020 election in his state that was wrought with fraud. It’s not clear if Ruby Freeman or Ralph Jones, Sr. were on the call. In the one-hour phone call on Saturday, President Trump insisted he won the state and threatened vague legal consequences. Raffensperger’s team leaked the call to the far-left Washington Post. It took 24 hours for the Washington Post to publish a hit piece, using edited audio clips, on the president’s phone call. Georgia Republican chairman David Shafer later announced that President Trump and his team filed two lawsuits against Secretary of State Raffensperger. David Shafer: President Donald Trump has filed two lawsuits – federal and state – against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. This was after Raffensperger secretly recorded the “confidential settlement discussion” of that litigation that is still pending. The audio published by the Washington Post is heavily edited and omits the stipulation that all discussions were for the purpose of settling litigation and confidential under federal and state law. Dirtbag Brad Raffensperger is in serious trouble. What is with this guy? Why is he so determined to defend the massive fraud in his state?

6bd820f6,Kamala Harris Says She Supports Your Second Amendment Rights. Her Record Proves Otherwise,"We knew that Joe Biden’s vice-presidential pick wasn’t going to be an NRA member or a Second Amendment supporter, but that doesn’t mean he had to pick someone who actually argued in 2008 that Washington, D.C.’s ban on handguns didn’t violate the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. As District Attorney in San Francisco, Kamala Harris signed on to an amicus brief filed with the Supreme Court in the Heller case, arguing that “for nearly 70 years courts have consistently sustained criminal firearms laws against Second Amendment challenges by holding that, inter alia, i the Second Amendment provides only a militia-related right to bear arms, ii the Second Amendment does not apply to legislation passed by state or local governments, and iii the restrictions bear a reasonable relationship to protecting public safety and thus do not violate a personal constitutional right.” The brief, written by Adrian Fenty at the time the Attorney General for Washington, D.C. urged the Supreme Court to uphold the District’s ban on handgun ownership, as well as a firearms storage law requiring guns to be kept locked up or disassembled with ammunition stored separately. To do otherwise, claimed Fenty, Harris, and several other prosecutors, would create “a broad private right to possess any firearm that is a ‘lineal descendant’ of a founding era weapon and that is in ‘common use’ with a ‘military application’ today.” Create a right. In other words, Kamala Harris told the Supreme Court that Americans didn’t have an individual right to possess a firearm that is in common use, turning a right of the people into a privilege to be exercised by a chosen few. Harris lost the argument in 2008, but she’s been opposing the right to keep and bear arms ever since. As District Attorney, Harris demanded an end to gun shows at the Cow Palace convention center just outside of the San Francisco city limits, and as California’s Attorney General she not only defended the state’s gun control laws in court, but according to California Rifle & Pistol Association president Chuck Michel, she failed to properly oversee several databases that the state uses to determine whether or not someone is eligible to own a firearm. .. not one but two separate Reports from the California State Auditor have found serious problems with the way the DOJ processes mental health records to determine a person’s firearm eligibility. Despite these multiple admonitions, Harris has failed to fix the problems. A 2013 Report from the California State Auditor found that under Harris, the DOJ “had not sufficiently reached out to the courts or mental health facilities to remind them to promptly report required information,” which if done would have allowed the DOJ to determine when dangerously mentally ill persons were in possession of firearms or attempting to purchase them. Additionally, this report found that: [K]ey decisions, such as whether a person is prohibited, are left to staff whose work does not receive a supervisory review. Because of these issues, Justice cannot identify all armed prohibited persons in California as effectively as it should, and the information it uses to ensure public safety by confiscating firearms is incomplete. As U.S. Senator, Kamala Harris has backed bans on so-called assault weapons, universal background check mandates, and more, but it was her short-lived presidential campaign that really allowed her to once again tout her anti-gun agenda. Harris proclaimed that if she was elected president, she would enact gun control with or without the support of Congress. “Five million assault weapons are on the streets of America today. During the course of this debate, eight people will die from gun violence. We need action, and Congress has had years to act and failed because they do not have the courage. When I’m elected, I’ll give them 100 days to pull their act together, put a bill on my desk for signature and if they don’t, I will take executive action and put in place a comprehensive background check requirement and ban the importation of assault weapons into our country, because it is time to act.” Expect the media to highlight the fact that Harris says she owns a gun, in order to portray her as some sort of “moderate” on the issue of the right to keep and bear arms. She’s not a moderate. She’s a hypocrite. Here’s what she told a CNN townhall audience last April. “I am a gun owner, and I own a gun for probably the reason a lot of people do — for personal safety,” the California Democrat said Thursday. “I was a career prosecutor.” Remember, as a career prosecutor Harris argued that you and I don’t have a right to own a handgun for personal safety, and that local governments should be able to ban you and I from legally possessing one. As a member of law enforcement, of course Harris would have been exempt from the very gun bans she wanted to keep in place in Washington, D.C., but she wanted local governments to be able to strip you of your ability to legally own a firearm for self-defense. Harris may own a gun, but that doesn’t mean she believes that you have a right to own one too.",false
ad0f9105,Video Shows A Truck Unloading Riot Gear For All The Protestors,"As Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron held a press conference to explain why Breonna Taylor’s killers were not indicted in her death, activists prepared themselves for ongoing protests. A witness observed a U-Haul truck loaded with protective gear unloading the supplies to prepare the protestors for police backlash come nightfall.  The U-Haul truck was spotted on Wednesday at 2 pm. This happened after the grand jury did not charge the police officers in the death of the young female first responder. Cops had botched a raid on her apartment and shot her while she was sleeping in bed.  Taylor was killed on March 13, two months before George Floyd died on May 25. Police battered down her apartment door in the middle of the night without knocking. While they did have a search warrant, the police shocked sleeping Taylor and her boyfriend.  The so-called “riot gear” that the protestors removed from the U-Haul truck included “shields” that were made of canvas and other materials to enable them to stand together and raise awareness around police brutality.  The group of Black Lives Matter activists pulled hand-painted signs and banners from the moving truck, which included slogans like “Abolish the Police” and “Abolition Now!”  One woman was caught on camera shouting, “Shields, we got shields!”  Another woman, who appeared to be helping organize the supply drop-off, distributed masks for protestors to remain safe during the pandemic. They also handed out free goggles and water bottles to the people who have hit the streets for months to protest the way Taylor was killed in her bed.  The supplies that were distributed were designed for use in the peaceful protests that happened in the wake of the grand jury decision not to charge the police officers with Taylor’s death. While protests were peaceful throughout the day, violence occurred at night.  “They’re organized, and there’s funding behind this as well. We know that there was that one U-Haul, I wonder if there were others out there as well,” remarked Fox News contributor Deneen Borelli on-air.  Some people accused Trump and Republicans of empowering the protestors just so they could get beaten by police later.  “Does anyone else think that the Trump campaign or Republicans could be behind this U-Haul van handing out shields and ‘abolish the police’ signs in Louisville?” one person said, floating the conspiracy theory on Twitter. “It would just be so easy for Trump and the GOP to sell their stupid narrative, wouldn’t it?”  Although media organizations contacted U-Haul for comment, a spokesperson was not able to provide one or share the rental history of that particular vehicle with the public.  While the protests were peaceful all day, at nightfall, things changed. A group of heavily-armed police officers – resembling an army preparing for war – closed in on a group of protestors and fired shots. The police were trying to disperse the crowd before the 9 pm curfew went into effect.  Rounds were fired after police bombarded the peaceful protesters with “flash-bang” rounds and chemical bombs. Two officers were shot. Friendly-fire was not ruled out as the cause.  Every time you share an AWM story, you help build a home for a disabled veteran.",false
8cead4c2,"BUSTED: CDC Inflated COVID Numbers, Accused of Violating Federal Law","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE. CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson. READ THE LANDMARK RESEARCH HERE The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine. “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study. “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens. “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens. “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists CSTE, a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5, new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license section VII.A3 – page 5, and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case section VII.B – page 7,” stated All Concerned Citizens. “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME, to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated. So…do you still trust the globalist oligarchs?",false

Before we dive into the post on OneWire, we need to discuss a few things.  What Is AP News’s OneWire?  OneWire is the name of a service that connects agencies and reporters from across the planet together. Their job is simple. Make a platform that makes it easy to share information between verified sources in order to cut down on misinformation. Hence the name “Associated Press” and “OneWire”. OneWire can only be accessed by content providers and sharing partners in the news networks in the United States and abroad.  Can I Read AP OneWire Articles?  The general public cannot read AP OneWire press releases until a provider or other journal agency releases the text of that article for public viewing. Once that occurs, it is called a “lead off”. A lead off will act as a source for the information. Sometimes, these articles are leaked before they are shared by content providers, such is the case as I will allow you to see it.  DHS’s Press Release  Notes: This release is not public. I can share the link all I want, and unless you have an AP OneWire account through your employer, you simply will not be able to view it. Nobody else will allow this to go public either, so I decided to leak it. We deserve to know what’s going on.",false

She is concerned that the votes will be counted in time and that she will be the ruler of this country.  She’s also taking steps to prepare the house to vote should the electric not be able to form a majority for President of the United States. This is something that hasn’t been done in over 118 years.  If the electorate cannot name a majority candidate for president, the House then turns to vote for the President and the Senate for the VP. Knowing Nancy, if she was to take over as president of the United States we would all be in deep shit.  She already wants to stack the court and legalize abortion. It’s unclear how long she would actually have as president but you can expect that she would do whatever she could to destroy this great country.  We would not be safe. Our constitution would be torn up by someone who hates everything that makes this country great.",false
6ac3e6b6,New research of toxic bait might provide control of wild hog problem in Texas and other states,"The rapid and uncontrolled population growth of feral swine in Texas and other affected states has been a severe problem for at least the last decade, damages caused by the wild animals reaching into the millions just in Texas.  Nationally, feral swine cause major damage to property, agriculture crops and livestock, native species and ecosystems, and cultural and historic resources. This invasive species costs the United States an estimated $1.5 billion each year in damages and control costs.  Related: No end in sight for Texas' war against feral swine  In addition to these concerns, because of their very nature, feral swine, which wallow along river banks, lakes and ponds, are known to spread diseases to other types of wildlife, and domestic animals. Feral pigs are also becoming a problem in some suburban areas as they root up turf at homes, parks and golf courses. They also turn over and root through trash cans in suburban areas and pose a driving hazard when moving in large numbers near roadways and highways.  In recent years a major effort to control population numbers has helped, but wildlife and public health officials say more needs to be done. But with an estimated five million feral swine running free in the United States, controlling the problem appears to be greater than current efforts to manage their numbers.  Limited Control Options  Existing control methods include hunting and trapping the animals, but in spite of eliminating a considerable number of the animals, feral swine continue to spread into other states not previously known to be feeding or breeding grounds. Overall, 39 states have reported some level of problem with wild pigs.  Texas is home to more feral pigs than any other state — an estimated 30 percent to 50 percent of all feral swine in the nation, according to USDA. More effort to reduce their numbers has occurred in Texas than anywhere else, representing more traps, more hunts, and more research. Yet their numbers are growing, and so is the amount of damage they cause each year.  In 2017 Texas Commissioner of Agriculture Sid Miller unveiled a wide-reaching plan to deal with the feral hog problem, calling for what he termed a hog-apocalypse involving the distribution of a deadly poison bait. Miller initially approved the legal use of a commercial poison that contained warfarin, the same drug used to kill rats or prescribed by doctors, in smaller doses, to prevent blood clots. Once feral swine ingest the poison, they begin to bleed internally. But hunters and conservationists expressed concern, fearing other animals may be exposed to the toxin, possibly affecting any animal or human predator feeding on the meat of a poisoned pig.  Shortly after announcing its use, the manufacturer of the poison bait voluntarily removed the product from the market out of fear of lawsuits and other possible retribution.  Toxic Bait Evaluation  Now, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service APHIS is evaluating another type of oral toxic bait for use with invasive feral swine. APHIS received an Experimental Use Permit EUP from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to conduct sodium nitrite toxic bait field trials on free-roaming feral swine in Texas and Alabama last November, and signed a final environmental assessment and issued a Decision and Finding of No Significant Impact FONSI associated with conducting field trials using the poison.  Wildlife Services takes the selection and use of toxic baits for use in wildlife damage management very seriously. The final environmental assessments, FONSI and EUP, are the result of years of collaborative research by Wildlife Services and multiple private, state, federal and international partners, reports APHIS Wildlife Services WS Deputy Administrator Bill Clay. With these in place, we can now begin field trials to help determine the effectiveness of the sodium nitrite toxic bait for removing feral swine sounders in natural settings, as well as any potential impacts to non-target wildlife.  Safeguards  Clay says the EUP allows researchers to partner with landowners to identify and target three to nine feral swine sounders herds each in Texas and Alabama. He said bait delivery systems designed to prevent access by non-target wildlife will be filled with placebo bait, placed in the sounders’ territories and monitored with motion-activated cameras.  Following a period of acclimation to confirm feral swine use of the baiting areas, the placebo bait will be replaced with sodium nitrite toxic bait for two nights. As a research method, at least 30 feral swine and no more than 30 raccoons in each state’s study area are to be captured live and radio-collared prior to baiting in order to monitor their movements and exposure to the bait. Landowners within 300 meters of bait stations will be notified, and signs will be placed on bait stations and along roads leading into the study areas.  Sodium nitrite NaNO2 is a meat preservative commonly used to cure meats such as sausage and bacon. When eaten in high doses over a short period of time, it is toxic to feral swine. The mode of death is similar to carbon monoxide poisoning. Once enough sodium nitrite bait is eaten, the feral swine gets faint, is rendered unconscious, and quickly dies. In most cases, feral swine die within two and-a-half to three hours after eating a lethal dose, Clay said.  Researchers say many factors are considered when developing a toxic bait for feral swine. Not only must it be effective and humane in eliminating feral swine, but also must be low risk for those handling it, the environment, and wildlife. Other wildlife, such as raccoons, bears and deer, may be attracted to the sodium nitrite toxic bait, but to prevent non-target species from accessing it, researchers will use delivery systems and baiting strategies designed to target feral swine. Trials will not be conducted in areas with known black bear populations.  The trials are scheduled to begin in both Alabama and Texas as early as February.  Although trapping, aerial operations, and recreational hunting of feral swine have effectively reduced damage in some areas, studies show that at least 70 percent of feral swine must be removed each year in order to prevent population growth, Clay said. Should the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approve the toxic bait for use with feral swine, it could become another tool in the toolbox for integrated feral swine damage management.  Skeptics  While farmers welcome technology that helps to control the damaging swine in their fields, there are skeptics.  Roland Ortiz, a commercial trapper and hunter in the San Antonio area, says wild hogs are very intelligent creatures, and they are prolific breeders. Ortiz stays busy hunting and trapping hogs on farms, ranches and lately in subdivisions that contract his services.  We are slowly pushing back into more sparsely populated areas, but they keep coming back. Managing them is a full time job, Ortiz said.  While he agrees a toxic bait would help to control wild swine populations, he doubts anything will ever solve the problem.  We have rat poison, but there's still lots of rats, Ortiz notes.",partially false
1d925d14,"Labour Will End Unpatriotic Tax-Dodging, Jeremy Corbyn Vows","Jeremy Corbyn used his second keynote speech as Labour leader to launch an excoriating attack on wealthy individuals and corporations that avoid UK taxes – and pledged that a Labour government led by him would end the practice forever.  There is nothing more unpatriotic than not paying your taxes, he told delegates in the packed-out conference hall in Liverpool, to loud applause.  It is an act of vandalism, damaging our NHS, damaging older people’s social care, damaging younger people’s education. So a Labour government will make shabby tax avoidance a thing of the past.  HMRC estimates that illegal tax evasion and legal tax avoidance together cost the government about £34 billion a year, though in practice most experts agree much less than this could ever actually be collected. Successive Labour and Conservative governments have pledged to crack down on tax avoidance.  Corbyn also singled out former BHS owner Sir Philip Green for criticism over his tax affairs in a section of the speech attacking the Conservative government.  They’ve cut taxes for the privileged few, sold off our national assets to them, always on the cheap, and turned a blind eye to their chronic tax avoidance, he said of the Conservatives.  They’re so committed to the interests of the very richest they recruited Sir Philip Green into government as something called an efficiency tsar. Well, government might be a bit more efficient if the super rich like Sir Philip actually paid their taxes.  Green, who owns Topshop, was knighted by the last Labour government but was appointed as efficiency tsar by David Cameron in 2010. Green's companies are owned through his wife, who is based in Monaco, which means his family's tax liabilities are legally – but substantially – reduced versus what he would pay if he and his wife were UK-resident.",false
f43a6abc,Pelosi Wants To Remove Votes From Soldiers Overseas: ‘They Don’t Even Live Here’,"It has long been established that Democrats cheat in order to win elections. They have undocumented citizens cast votes for them, they have dead people vote for them, have people of color vote for them, and the list goes on and on.  No, they have sunk to a new low. Nancy Pelosi and her cronies seek to disrespect our troops even more than they have thus far through defunding and constant criticism of heroic acts. Pelosi announced today that she intends to bring forth a new bill that would disqualify members of the military who serve overseas from voting in the coming presidential election.  Most people automatically assumed that this was being proposed in response to Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting. A tit-for-tat situation. Pelosi knows that 95 percent of military personnel support Trump and saw an opportunity to eliminate those votes. The truth is actually much more sinister.  The announcement was met with snark and outrage from her Republican counterparts who called Pelosi an unAmerican fascist communist totalitarian Russian trader. The Speaker of the House was quick to respond:  “Voting is a privilege for Americans who will be affected by the decisions of the elected. Republicans have pointed this out to us many times. So I’m just playing along. Some of these young men and women have been out of country for years. Why should they get to vote? They don’t even live here. We need to strengthen our elections, not weaken them by allowing foreigners to participate. That’s essentially what these soldiers have become- foreigners. They’ve given up on being American by working for so long out of country. American elections are for Americans. There is some point to be made here, but I’ll figure that out later.”  Nancy Pelosi appears to be becoming quite senile in her old age. That loss of her wits has made her forget who our American military is and what do you do for us. They are, perhaps, the most American of us all.",false
9dd3f5d4,Rail commuters squeezed further as season tickets rise faster than wages,"Get ready for another big rise in train fares. This Wednesday we’ll see the publication of the latest retail prices index RPI. The Office for National Statistics thinks it is such a poor indicator of prices that it now designates it as “Not a National Statistic.” Yet this non-statistic, which is nearly always significantly higher than the CPI consumer prices index is nonetheless used as the official basis for raising train fares. And all the signs are that the squeeze on commuters is only going to get worse.  The cost of season tickets for commuters goes up in January, but the rise is dictated by the level of RPI the previous July, a figure usually published in mid-August. When the July figure for RPI is released this Wednesday, it will be at least 3.4% its current level but more likely 3.5% or even 3.6%, as petrol prices and home energy bill increases feed into the index. So with grim inevitability train fares will, yet again, rise faster than wages.  If rail fares were to go up in line with CPI, we could expect a rise of 2.4% next January. If they went up in line with wages, we’d expect a 2.5% increase. But the RPI formula means they regularly go up faster than wages. This time last year the RPI was 3.6%, enabling the rail companies to shove through big price increases on commuter routes at a time when wage growth was stalling.  What does a 3.5% rise mean in practice? For commuters from Cambridge into London terminals’ such as King’s Cross, the annual season ticket at the beginning of 2019 will smash through the £5,000 level, jumping from £4,952 to £5,125.  It’s worth noting that in Germany, Deutsche Bahn offers the BahnCard 100 that lets you board any train anywhere in the country for a year for €4,270 £3,840. In Britain we expect commuters to pay £1,263 more than that just for a 48-mile commuter journey from Cambridgeshire into the capital.  Meanwhile, a 3.5% rise will see the annual season ticket from Tunbridge Wells into London terminals jump from £4,644 to £4,806, while Reading to London will go from £4,464 to £4,620. Rochdale to Manchester will cost £1,196 instead of £1,156. And spare a thought for the miserable passengers on Britain’s officially most overcrowded route, the early morning train from Uckfield in Sussex to London Bridge, which on average is 250% full. They can expect to fork out another £105 on top of the £3,000 they are currently paying for an annual season ticket.  As the chancellor, Philip Hammond, prepares his autumn budget, he might want to listen to the Campaign for Better Transport: “We want the government to commit to a fares freeze and hold regulated rail fares at their current level. The government has frozen fuel duty for the last seven years and we think rail passengers should be given the same treatment. Given the mess surrounding the new timetable, the lack of improvements and the failure to deliver compensation, the government cannot go on telling passengers that fare increases are justified.”  Our train companies this week said they are trying to clean up ticketing. The Rail Delivery Group is getting rid of language such as “route direct”, “any permitted” and “London terminals” to simplify the system. It even proclaims there has already been an 11% improvement in the number of people buying the wrong ticket at a vending machine. But it remains absolutely astonishing that one in 10 ticket buyers still purchase the wrong ticket – usually leaving the traveller out of pocket, not the rail company – because we have such an absurdly complicated fares structure.

9401748d,European royals killing naked children for fun at human hunting parties,"This is one in a series of articles taken from eyewitness testimony before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. Five international judges are examining evidence of child rape, torture, murder and kidnapping allegedly done by global elite members of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. Regular Ninth Circle child sacrifices were said to take place in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals, the Vatican, on private estates and groves and government military bases in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, Ireland, France, England and the US. At least 34 child mass grave sites were identified in Ireland, Spain and Canada – and refused excavation by the respective governments, Crown of England and Catholic Church. Named as present in Ninth Circle activities were Pope Francis, former Pope Ratzinger;Anglican, United Church of Canada and Catholic Church officials including Cardinals; members of European royalty including Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip; officials of the Canadian, Australian, UK and US military and governments including the USA’s CIA, plus prominent government ministers, judges, politicians and businessmen from the US, Belgium, Holland, Canada, Australia, France, Ireland and the UK.  Teens were drugged, stripped naked, raped, hunted down in the woods and killed by European royals according to this week’s latest eyewitness to testify before the International Common Law Court of Justice in Brussels. The woman was the fourth eyewitness to give accounts about these human hunting parties of the global elite Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult network. A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland.  “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16, hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”  Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace.  Dutch therapist Toos Nijenhuis claimed that as a four year-old she was forced to witness murders of children that involved former Pope Ratzinger, a Dutch Catholic Cardinal, plus the father of Netherlands Belgium Queen Beatrix and Bilderberger Founder, Dutch Crown Prince Alfrink Bernhard. “I saw the former Pope Joseph Ratzinger murder a little girl″ another witness confirmed. “It was at a French chateau in the fall of 1987. It was ugly, horrible and didn’t happen just once. Ratzinger and Bernhard were some of the more prominent men who took part.”  In Ireland, Spain and Canada 34 child mass grave sites were discovered and appeared linked to Ninth Circle activities. The largest was the Mohawk Indian Residential School in Brantford Ontario where child remains were identified in 2008 before the Catholic Church, Canadian government and English Crown shut down the dig by professional archeologists. The 2013 ICLCJ Court had found Queen Elizabeth and Prince Phillip guilty for the Oct. 10 1964 disappearance of ten native children from the Catholic residential school in Kamloops British Columbia. In the first two weeks of the 2014 court witnesses identified Dutch and Belgian royal participants in the rape and killing of Mohawk children and newborns. Named were Bernhard and King Hendrick, consort to Queen Wilhelmina of Holland.  Alleged to be present during the human hunting parties were the late Prince Johan Friso and his wife Mabel Wisse Smit, former ministers, the top man of the Dutch army, the under secretary of the Raad Van State in the Netherlands, the Vice-Roy next to Queen Beatrix and other global business and political leaders including some from the US. “Surely the present King Willem Alexander and King Filip and their wives know about this abuse and murder of children” said one eyewitness.”They do nothing about it and likely are the ones to stop investigations and prosecutions.”  In January 2014 the brother of the king of Holland Prince Johan Friso passed away in a coma after these three Dutch-language websites shown here reached the internet. The websites revealed that Friso was at the human hunting and killing parties.”The story came on the internet after years of trying to move the policy and justice department in the Netherlands to act against the criminals,” an eyewitness said. “Nobody did anything to stop these criminals, probably because Queen Beatrix and King Albert likely interfered with the investigations.”  Advertisement.

Two witnesses have named former Pope Joseph Ratzinger and Queen Beatrix’s father the deceased Prince Alfrink Bernhard, as being present at child sacrifices. Both were said to be Nazi sympathizers.  The ICLCJ Court received a collection of Jesuit archival records about a child sacrificial cult known as the Knights of Darkness. In 1933 the Knights were established by the Catholic Jesuits and Nazi Waffen S.S. Division. The records showed Ratzinger was identified as a member of the Knights while working as an S.S. Chaplain’s assistant at the Ravensbruck Concentration Camp in Germany. The records also stated that Ratzinger participated in child sacrificial rites using kidnapped children from the camps or political prisoners.  Another court document called the Magisterial Privilege indicated child sacrifice was a regular occurrence at the Vatican. At the tender age of 12 “Svali” of San Diego County California claimed she was brought to catacombs beneath the Vatican to witness the sacrifice of a three year-old drugged boy. In this video her interviewer said that 24 years prior a “Maria” told him she witnessed another satanic child sacrifice rite in the same Vatican Catacombs.  Last week an Irish police investigator reported to the ICLCJ Court that the close to 800 babies buried in a Catholic Nun’s septic tank were dismembered, decapitated and in bits and pieces – signs that they could have been murdered in Satanic child sacrifice rites. In the last two months the ICLCJ Court has heard these heart-wrenching testimonies about the rape, torture and murder of children as recently as 2010 by Catholic leaders, European royal family members and other global elites. Murder sites of the Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult were said to be in the catacombs of Catholic Cathedrals including the Vatican and on private estates, military establishments and groves in Belgium, Holland, Spain, Australia, France, England and the US.  The ICLCJ Court has been overwhelmed with newly discovered evidence and a number of new witnesses coming forward to testify about Ninth Circle Satanic Child Sacrifice Cult activities. They have uncovered Ninth Circle Satanic Cult member possible involvement in international child sacrifice, kidnapping, exploitation and drug rings. The five international judges and 27 jury members were expected to remain in session for at least a year due to the complexity of the cases.  Amnesty has been offered to citizens or employees of the Vatican, Crown of England, churches or governments willing to give sworn testimony or evidence that leads to the prosecution of these global elites suspected of committing crimes. Rewards up to 10,000 euros or around 13,660 dollars was available through the ICLCJ court.  The ICLCJ Court had over 450 Common Law Peace Officers in 13 countries, with 51 local chartered groups operating. Local organizing funds were available for common law groups that applied through the International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State.

7842996d,Austin rejects bond for urban rail by wide margin - Austin Monitor,"Despite the backing of Mayor Lee Leffingwell and many of the city’s power brokers, Austin’s $1 billion transportation bond proposal, Proposition 1, went down to defeat Tuesday night. Opponents say it was the wrong plan in the wrong place, but those pushing for the mass transit system say it might have been Austin’s last chance at rail for a decade or more.  It was a crushing defeat for Austin’s only proposition on the ballot, which was voted down by about a 14 percent margin.  Citizens Against Rail Taxes founder Jim Skaggs told the Austin Monitor that he was elated.  “I think it’s a win, win, win. It’s a win for the taxpayers, it’s a win for transportation, and it’s a win for a system of transparency,” said Skaggs. “This entire plan was put together without any transparency, and what we need is a total mobility plan which is shared by the community and that is the only way to address the problems we have.”  He continued: “This rail was a huge cost for all taxpayers, the biggest taxpayer increase in history, on a community already burdened by the fastest growing tax increases of any major city in the nation … It was a huge portion of our funds for a minuscule portion of our needs. More than anything else, this thing proves that we need cost effective solutions for mobility, and those cost effective solutions have to address mobility for everybody, not for a minuscule few paid for and subsidized by all the rest.”  Let’s Go Austin campaign manager Lynda Rife was not elated.  “We’re disappointed. We worked really hard. We thought we had a good balance of roads and rail on the ballot. We thought we picked a route that would bring in the federal dollars, but the voters said, ‘No’,” said Rife.  Skaggs and Rife also had different hopes for the future, though both hoped to see Austin’s traffic problems addressed.  Skaggs said he’d like to see other, more transparent, transportation options considered by city planners in the future.  “I’d like to see two things,” said Skaggs “One, recognize that 99 percent of every trip is made on the roadways, be it private or public transit or shared or emergency or school or government vehicles, it’s on roads. And we need to fix our road system to accommodate that transportation. Second, we need to upgrade our transit system to support those people who need transit in their daily lives and have no alternative. And we need to stop trying to get people out of their cars to ride trains and other transit modes which are not viable for the 99.5 percent of the travelers.”  When asked whether she had plans for the future, Rife said, “110 people will move here tomorrow, and the next day and the next day. I’m hoping that someone is thinking about some kind of solutions.”  Rife hoped that transportation issues can be fixed, saying, “I think it’s choking our city, it’s a nightmare, and I’m worried about Austin. I’m hoping that the people who said that this wasn’t the right plan find a plan that they can support and we can all support.”  The pitch for an urban rail line was hotly debated on a number of fronts. Pro-rail supporters pointed to congestion and economic viability as reasons to support the line. They further argued that the passage of $600 million in city bond funds would leverage a matching $600 million from the federal government for the project. And they noted that a $400 million promise — seen in some quarters as a blatant pitch for support from the road warrior faction of the mobility infrastructure debate — attached to the rail bonds would ensure that necessary road work wouldn’t be left behind.  To make their case, supporters formed a political action committee, Let’s Go Austin, to fund outreach. As of that organization’s eight-day-out report, it had spent roughly $700,000. The money funded television ads, direct mail efforts and more.  Opponents of the project argued from two main camps: One, that the route and data behind the route selection were flawed, and another that fought the idea based on the prospective 6 cent per $100 of assessed property valuation tax increase.  Route opponents, loosely clumped as the Our Rail initiative, argued that the selected route — one that would extend from Highland Mall south through the University of Texas campus and downtown, across Lady Bird Lake and then east out East Riverside Drive — was not the right choice. They argued for a track that would instead run along the Lamar-Guadelupe corridor.  Meanwhile, advocates with the group AURA pushed hard against data delivered by city consultants as the project evaluation proceedings continued. Both Our Rail and AURA remained extremely vocal about their various stances via social media and at city meetings called to discuss the project.  Citizens Against Rail Taxes, or CART, followed more traditional lines in arguing that the route would be too expensive for taxpayers and relatively ineffective.  Three groups spent money arguing against the rail bond: As of the eight-day-out reports, CART had raised more than $114,000 and spent nearly $272,000. DeRail Austin raised $12,000 for that period and had spent $53,034. Our Rail spent $4,806.  This year’s result is the third time since 2000 that Austin Council members have gone to the polls for a vote on a rail project. The 2000 vote — on a fairly comprehensive rail system — came up just short. Then, in 2004, voters approved funds to construct the Capital MetroRail Red Line.

d46e2ede,Vladimir Putin’s daughter DIES after second dose of COVID vaccine – Toronto Today,"Share Messenger Tweet Email Whatsapp reddit  August 15, 2020  Moscow, Russia  Conflicting Conspiracy File 🟡  Update:  Snopes and a variety of other fact checkers attacked the claims made in this article. It is important to note, despite labelling the claim as false, none of the fact-checking websites actually disproved the claim that Putin’s daughter died after her second dose of Sputnik V.  It is important to note Putin’s Daughter has not made a public appearance since the claim was made. Further evidence is needed to completely debunk the original claim. Once she is seen in public, and the video can be independently verified, it can be said the original claim was inaccurate.  Until then, this file has been updated to “conflicting”.  Original Article:  Vladimir Putin’s daughter suffered unexpected side effects to the experimental Russian COVID vaccine, and has passed away in Moscow. The Kremlin has yet to make a statement on her death. A source within Russia’s inner circle stated that Putin’s daughter – Katerina Tikhonova – suffered a rise in temperature shortly after her second injection, and then suffered a seizure. Doctors were not able to reverse the side-effects of the vaccine, and she was pronounced dead late yesterday evening.  The Russian vaccine is named Sputnik V, after the first artificial satellite, launched into space by the Russians in 1957. It is also noteworthy that Sputnik is the name of Russia’s International News Station, which has been accused of being a propaganda wing of the Kremlin.  Russian vaccine 'Sputnik V' may be a new Chernobyl. — El Come Callao' @panzenu August 15, 2020  Prior to Katerina’s death, Russian Doctor Sergei Tsarenko stated that releasing the vaccine early was the better out of 2 options. In his opinion, it was better just to move ahead, as opposed to letting people die.  However, Western doctors were fearful of Russia bypassing stage 3 trials and rushing the drug to market, warning it could have devastating effects.  Abram L. Wagner, Professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan had this to say on a rushed COVID-19 vaccine.  Although it would be wonderful to get a vaccine into the population quickly, there could be substantial downsides if researchers and manufacturers cut corners. Imagine a vaccine that often had serious side effects that weren’t caught in small trials before it was widely administered. Source: https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/russia-is-cutting-corners-on-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-heres-why-they-matter  Now it appears, Katerina Tikhonova is the first official fatality of the Russian COVID-19 vaccine. Proving that Sputnik V was not safe, and skipping stage 3 trials was a misguided move on the Kremlin’s part.  The Kremlin is known to spread disinformation, so it is likely it will lie about Putin’s daughter’s death, or else blame her death on something other than the vaccine.  *Disclaimer: This article has been labelled as a Conspiracy File,  and does not necessarily reflect the views of Toronto Today.

The federal budget records expenses for investment projects up front, not over the project’s lifetime of use. Because of that mismatch between when costs are recorded and when benefits occur, investment projects may seem expensive relative to other government expenditures, and the large amounts of up-front funding required for some types of investments can make it difficult to fund them within the constraints of the budget process.

4ce1af1d,Buffalo Officials Duped By Professional Antifa Provocateur,"Martin Gugino is a 75-year-old professional agitator and Antifa provocateur who brags on his blog about the number of times he can get arrested and escape prosecution. According to Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown “There has been vandalism, there have been fires set, there have been stores broken into & looted. According to what was reported to me, that individual was a key major instigator of people engaging in those activities.”  Mr. Gugino’s Twitter Account is also filled with anti-cop sentiment [SEE HERE]. Last Thursday Gugino traveled from his New York home in Amherst, to Buffalo where he was seen on camera agitating a protest crowd. One of the protesters earlier remarked that Mr. Gugino was “acting like an asshole”, and “trying to get punched in the face.”  During his effort Gugino was attempting to capture the radio communications signature of Buffalo police officers. CTH noted what he was attempting on Thursday night as soon as the now viral video was being used by media to sell a police brutality narrative. [Thread Here] Today, a more clear video has emerged that shows exactly what he was attempting.  In this slow motion video, you will see Gugino using a phone as a capture scanner. You might have heard the term “skimming”; it’s essentially the same. Watch him use his right hand to first scan the mic of officer one top left of chest. Then Gugino moves his hand to the communications belt of the second officer. WATCH CLOSELY:  .  The capture of communications signals [explained in detail here] is a method of police tracking used by Antifa to monitor the location of police. In some cases the more high tech capture software can even decipher communication encryption allowing the professional agitators to block black-out, jam, or interfere with police communication. In addition, many police body-cams are bluetooth enabled which allows syncing.  Unfortunately in the modern era the professional agitators have become very sophisticated and use technology to help create chaos. Their activity is highly coordinated, and as James O’Keefe has revealed in his undercover operations these professionals even stage events to manipulate public opinion.  When he was pushed away by the officers Gugino fell and presumably hit his head. As a consequence of the shove, the two officers were suspended and the Buffalo authorities have arrested and charged the two police officers. In a show of support the entire Buffalo police unit that makes up the Emergency Response Team resigned their position.  On Friday Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown admitted Gugino was a professional ‘agitator’ who tried to work up the crowd and had been asked to leave the area ‘numerous’ times.  However, despite the known ideology and intent of Mr. Gugino; and despite a more careful look at the video highlighting exactly what Gugino was attempting; the Buffalo authorities are frozen by political correctness and have now arrested and charged the two officers.  Via Daily Mail – Two Buffalo cops have been arrested and charged with second degree assault after they shoved a 75-year-old peace activist to the ground Thursday causing him to crack his head open on the sidewalk, as hundreds of colleagues gathered outside the city court in solidarity to cheer their release without bail. Aaron Torgalski and Robert McCabe were each charged with one count of assault in the second degree in a court hearing Saturday morning over the shocking incident that left peaceful protester Martin Gugino in a ‘serious condition’ in hospital. The cops were arraigned in a virtual court hearing where they both pleaded not guilty to the charges and the two cops hid from the view of the camera. They each face up to seven years in prison if convicted of the class D felony. They were released without bail and will appear back in court on July 20.read more  It would appear Mr. Martin Gugino succeeded in his endeavor:  https://twitter.com/BenKTallmadge/status/1269261456580591623  https://twitter.com/DangPigeon/status/1269303926869889026  UPDATE 6/9/20 9:00pm ET: OAN News has additional details.  …  And a picture of Mr. Martin Gugino sitting up chatting on his cell phone before being loaded into the ambulance:",false
6a43c794,"Covid-19 had us all fooled, but now we might have finally found its secret.","Covid-19 had us all fooled, but now we might have finally found its secret. libertymavenstock Follow Apr 5 · 8 min read  In the last 3–5 days, a mountain of anecdotal evidence has come out of NYC, Italy, Spain, etc. about COVID-19 and characteristics of patients who get seriously ill. It’s not only piling up but now leading to a general field-level consensus backed up by a few previously little-known studies that we’ve had it all wrong the whole time. Well, a few had some things eerily correct cough Trump cough, especially with Hydroxychloroquine with Azithromicin, but we’ll get to that in a minute.  There is no ‘pneumonia’ nor ARDS. At least not the ARDS with established treatment protocols and procedures we’re familiar with. Ventilators are not only the wrong solution, but high pressure intubation can actually wind up causing more damage than without, not to mention complications from tracheal scarring and ulcers given the duration of intubation often required… They may still have a use in the immediate future for patients too far to bring back with this newfound knowledge, but moving forward a new treatment protocol needs to be established so we stop treating patients for the wrong disease.  The past 48 hours or so have seen a huge revelation: COVID-19 causes prolonged and progressive hypoxia starving your body of oxygen by binding to the heme groups in hemoglobin in your red blood cells. People are simply desaturating losing o2 in their blood, and that’s what eventually leads to organ failures that kill them, not any form of ARDS or pneumonia. All the damage to the lungs you see in CT scans are from the release of oxidative iron from the hemes, this overwhelms the natural defenses against pulmonary oxidative stress and causes that nice, always-bilateral ground glass opacity in the lungs. Patients returning for re-hospitalization days or weeks after recovery suffering from apparent delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy strengthen the notion COVID-19 patients are suffering from hypoxia despite no signs of respiratory ‘tire out’ or fatigue.  Here’s the breakdown of the whole process, including some ELI5-level cliff notes. Much has been simplified just to keep it digestible and layman-friendly.  Your red blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to all your organs and the rest of your body. Red blood cells can do this thanks to hemoglobin, which is a protein consisting of four “hemes”. Hemes have a special kind of iron ion, which is normally quite toxic in its free form, locked away in its center with a porphyrin acting as it’s ‘container’. In this way, the iron ion can be ‘caged’ and carried around safely by the hemoglobin, but used to bind to oxygen when it gets to your lungs.  When the red blood cell gets to the alveoli, or the little sacs in your lungs where all the gas exchange happens, that special little iron ion can flip between FE2+ and FE3+ states with electron exchange and bond to some oxygen, then it goes off on its little merry way to deliver o2 elsewhere.  Here’s where COVID-19 comes in. Its glycoproteins bond to the heme, and in doing so that special and toxic oxidative iron ion is “disassociated” released. It’s basically let out of the cage and now freely roaming around on its own. This is bad for two reasons:  1 Without the iron ion, hemoglobin can no longer bind to oxygen. Once all the hemoglobin is impaired, the red blood cell is essentially turned into a Freightliner truck cab with no trailer and no ability to store its cargo.. it is useless and just running around with COVID-19 virus attached to its porphyrin. All these useless trucks running around not delivering oxygen is what starts to lead to desaturation, or watching the patient’s spo2 levels drop. It is INCORRECT to assume traditional ARDS and in doing so, you’re treating the WRONG DISEASE. Think of it a lot like carbon monoxide poisoning, in which CO is bound to the hemoglobin, making it unable to carry oxygen. In those cases, ventilators aren’t treating the root cause; the patient’s lungs aren’t ‘tiring out’, they’re pumping just fine. The red blood cells just can’t carry o2, end of story. Only in this case, unlike CO poisoning in which eventually the CO can break off, the affected hemoglobin is permanently stripped of its ability to carry o2 because it has lost its iron ion. The body compensates for this lack of o2 carrying capacity and deliveries by having your kidneys release hormones like erythropoietin, which tell your bone marrow factories to ramp up production on new red blood cells with freshly made and fully functioning hemoglobin. This is the reason you find elevated hemoglobin and decreased blood oxygen saturation as one of the 3 primary indicators of whether the shit is about to hit the fan for a particular patient or not.  2 That little iron ion, along with millions of its friends released from other hemes, are now floating through your blood freely. As I mentioned before, this type of iron ion is highly reactive and causes oxidative damage. It turns out that this happens to a limited extent naturally in our bodies and we have cleanup & defense mechanisms to keep the balance. The lungs, in particular, have 3 primary defenses to maintain “iron homeostasis”, 2 of which are in the alveoli, those little sacs in your lungs we talked about earlier. The first of the two are little macrophages that roam around and scavenge up any free radicals like this oxidative iron. The second is a lining on the walls called the epithelial surface which has a thin layer of fluid packed with high levels of antioxidant molecules.. things like abscorbic acid AKA Vitamin C among others. Well, this is usually good enough for naturally occurring rogue iron ions but with COVID-19 running rampant your body is now basically like a progressive state letting out all the prisoners out of the prisons… it’s just too much iron and it begins to overwhelm your lungs’ countermeasures, and thus begins the process of pulmonary oxidative stress. This leads to damage and inflammation, which leads to all that nasty stuff and damage you see in CT scans of COVID-19 patient lungs. Ever noticed how it’s always bilateral? both lungs at the same time Pneumonia rarely ever does that, but COVID-19 does… EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  — — — — — — — — — — — — -  Once your body is now running out of control, with all your oxygen trucks running around without any freight, and tons of this toxic form of iron floating around in your bloodstream, other defenses kick in. While your lungs are busy with all this oxidative stress they can’t handle, and your organs are being starved of o2 without their constant stream of deliveries from red blood cell’s hemoglobin, and your liver is attempting to do its best to remove the iron and store it in its ‘iron vault’. Only its getting overwhelmed too. It’s starved for oxygen and fighting a losing battle from all your hemoglobin letting its iron free, and starts crying out “help, I’m taking damage!” by releasing an enzyme called alanine aminotransferase ALT. BOOM, there is your second of 3 primary indicators of whether the shit is about to hit the fan for a particular patient or not.  Eventually, if the patient’s immune system doesn’t fight off the virus in time before their blood oxygen saturation drops too low, ventilator or no ventilator, organs start shutting down. No fuel, no work. The only way to even try to keep them going is max oxygen, even a hyperbaric chamber if one is available on 100% oxygen at multiple atmospheres of pressure, just to give what’s left of their functioning hemoglobin a chance to carry enough o2 to the organs and keep them alive. Yeah we don’t have nearly enough of those chambers, so some fresh red blood cells with normal hemoglobin in the form of a transfusion will have to do.  The core point being, treating patients with the iron ions stripped from their hemoglobin rendering it abnormally nonfunctional with ventilator intubation is futile, unless you’re just hoping the patient’s immune system will work its magic in time. The root of the illness needs to be addressed.  Best case scenario? Treatment regimen early, before symptoms progress too far. Hydroxychloroquine more on that in a minute, I promise with Azithromicin has shown fantastic, albeit critics keep mentioning ‘anecdotal’ to describe the mountain, promise and I’ll explain why it does so well next. But forget straight-up plasma with antibodies, that might work early but if the patient is too far gone they’ll need more. They’ll need all the blood: antibodies and red blood cells. No help in sending over a detachment of ammunition to a soldier already unconscious and bleeding out on the battlefield, you need to send that ammo along with some hemoglobin-stimulant-magic so that he can wake up and fire those shots at the enemy.  The story with Hydroxychloroquine  All that hilariously misguided and counterproductive criticism the media piled on chloroquine purely for political reasons as a viable treatment will now go down as the biggest Fake News blunder to rule them all. The media actively engaged their activism to fight ‘bad orange man’ at the cost of thousands of lives. Shame on them.  How does chloroquine work? Same way as it does for malaria. You see, malaria is this little parasite that enters the red blood cells and starts eating hemoglobin as its food source. The reason chloroquine works for malaria is the same reason it works for COVID-19 — while not fully understood, it is suspected to bind to DNA and interfere with the ability to work magic on hemoglobin. The same mechanism that stops malaria from getting its hands on hemoglobin and gobbling it up seems to do the same to COVID-19 essentially little snippets of DNA in an envelope from binding to it. On top of that, Hydroxychloroquine an advanced descendant of regular old chloroquine lowers the pH which can interfere with the replication of the virus. Again, while the full details are not known, the entire premise of this potentially ‘game changing’ treatment is to prevent hemoglobin from being interfered with, whether due to malaria or COVID-19.  No longer can the media and armchair pseudo-physicians sit in their little ivory towers, proclaiming “DUR so stoopid, malaria is bacteria, COVID-19 is virus, anti-bacteria drug no work on virus!”. They never got the memo that a drug doesn’t need to directly act on the pathogen to be effective. Sometimes it’s enough just to stop it from doing what it does to hemoglobin, regardless of the means it uses to do so.  Anyway, enough of the rant. What’s the end result here? First, the ventilator emergency needs to be re-examined. If you’re putting a patient on a ventilator because they’re going into a coma and need mechanical breathing to stay alive, okay we get it. Give ’em time for their immune systems to pull through. But if they’re conscious, alert, compliant — keep them on O2. Max it if you have to. If you HAVE to inevitably ventilate, do it at low pressure but max O2. Don’t tear up their lungs with max PEEP, you’re doing more harm to the patient because you’re treating the wrong disease.  Ideally, some form of treatment needs to happen to:  Inhibit viral growth and replication. Here plays CHQ+ZPAK+ZINC or other retroviral therapies being studies. Less virus, less hemoglobin losing its iron, less severity and damage. Therapies used for anyone with abnormal hemoglobin or malfunctioning red blood cells. Blood transfusions. Whatever, I don’t know the full breadth and scope because I’m not a physician. But think along those lines, and treat the real disease. If you’re thinking about giving them plasma with antibodies, maybe if they’re already in bad shape think again and give them BLOOD with antibodies, or at least blood followed by plasma with antibodies. Now that we know more about how this virus works and affects our bodies, a whole range of options should open up. Don’t trust China. China is ASSHOE. disclaimer: not talking about the people, just talking about the regime. They covered this up and have caused all kinds of death and carnage, both literal and economic. The ripples of this pandemic will be felt for decades.  Fini.",false

Governments love crises because when the people are fearful they are more willing to give up freedoms for promises that the government will take care of them. After 9/11, for example, Americans accepted the near-total destruction of their civil liberties in the PATRIOT Act’s hollow promises of security.It is ironic to see the same Democrats who tried to impeach President Trump last month for abuse of power demanding that the Administration grab more power and authority in the name of fighting a virus that thus far has killed less than 100 Americans.Declaring a pandemic emergency on Friday, President Trump now claims the power to quarantine individuals suspected of being infected by the virus and, as Politico writes, “stop and seize any plane, train or automobile to stymie the spread of contagious disease.” He can even call out the military to cordon off a US city or state.State and local authoritarians love panic as well. The mayor of Champaign, Illinois, signed an executive order declaring the power to ban the sale of guns and alcohol and cut off gas, water, or electricity to any citizen. The governor of Ohio just essentially closed his entire state.The chief fearmonger of the Trump Administration is without a doubt Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. Fauci is all over the media, serving up outright falsehoods to stir up even more panic. He testified to Congress that the death rate for the coronavirus is ten times that of the seasonal flu, a claim without any scientific basis.On Face the Nation, Fauci did his best to further damage an already tanking economy by stating, “Right now, personally, myself, I wouldn’t go to a restaurant.” He has pushed for closing the entire country down for 14 days.Over what? A virus that has thus far killed just over 5,000 worldwide and less than 100 in the United States? By contrast, tuberculosis, an old disease not much discussed these days, killed nearly 1.6 million people in 2017. Where’s the panic over this?If anything, what people like Fauci and the other fearmongers are demanding will likely make the disease worse. The martial law they dream about will leave people hunkered down inside their homes instead of going outdoors or to the beach where the sunshine and fresh air would help boost immunity. The panic produced by these fearmongers is likely helping spread the disease, as massive crowds rush into Walmart and Costco for that last roll of toilet paper.The madness over the coronavirus is not limited to politicians and the medical community. The head of the neoconservative Atlantic Council wrote an editorial this week urging NATO to pass an Article 5 declaration of war against the COVID-19 virus! Are they going to send in tanks and drones to wipe out these microscopic enemies?People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus “pandemic” could be a big hoax, with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit – financially or politically – from the ensuing panic.That is not to say the disease is harmless. Without question people will die from coronavirus. Those in vulnerable categories should take precautions to limit their risk of exposure. But we have seen this movie before. Government over-hypes a threat as an excuse to grab more of our freedoms. When the “threat” is over, however, they never give us our freedoms back.",false
b29fa73f,Sen. Ted Cruz: Facebook has been censoring or suppressing conservative speech for years,"When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee and Commerce Committee joint hearing Tuesday, I asked a relatively simple question: does Facebook consider itself a neutral public forum?  Zuckerberg said that Facebook is a “platform for all ideas,” but declined to give a “yes” or “no” answer. The problem is, this is not merely an academic distinction between words. Facebook’s answer to the question could affect millions of users, and attract or prevent a lot of attention from federal regulators.  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act CDA states: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.  This is a good provision. It means that, for example, if you run a blogging platform and someone posts a terrorist threat in the comments section, you’re not treated as the person making the threat. Without Section 230, many social media networks could be functionally unable to operate.  In order to be protected by Section 230, companies like Facebook should be “neutral public forums.” On the flip side, they should be considered to be a “publisher or speaker” of user content if they pick and choose what gets published or spoken.  As I expressed to Mark Zuckerberg, as a private business Facebook has a clear First Amendment right to publish whatever it wants on its website within the bounds of the law. The company can support political causes and oppose ones it disagrees with, just like a private citizen can speak his or her mind or agitate against opposing views.  But if Facebook is busy censoring legal, protected speech for political reasons, the company should be held accountable for the posts it lets through. And it should not enjoy any special congressional immunity from liability for its actions.  As we discussed at the Senate hearing, for years it has been evident that Facebook has actively censored or suppressed conservative speech.  In May 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including stories about the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC, Mitt Romney and Obama administration scandals.  Facebook’s actions have ranged from seemingly petty things – like shutting down a “Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day” to blocking posts from journalists, specific religious groups and most recently, grassroots Trump supporters Diamond and Silk.  Facebook’s explanation for limiting access to a popular page with 1.3 million Facebook followers was that it was “unsafe to the community.” Many Americans see this as just the latest poor excuse in a pervasive pattern of political bias.  While such stories abound, it is virtually unheard of to see any ads or pages from liberal groups like Planned Parenthood, Moveon.org, or Democratic candidates being targeted for removal.  Whether you call it targeting, censorship, or shadow-banning, these are not the actions of a “neutral public forum.”  Zuckerberg told the Senate hearing that his goal is “not to engage in political speech.” But if a company allows a politically biased corporate culture to persist – and deliberately avoids diversity of thought in its hires – its actions can very quickly escalate into the political realm and endanger its status as a true “platform for all ideas.”  According to Zuckerberg, Facebook employs over 15,000 people in security and content review. If all or virtually all are left-wing Democrats – and if they are empowered to secretly silence the voices of all with whom they disagree – that poses profound threats to our democratic discourse.  Newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, at the height of yellow journalism, never possessed such unchecked power over free speech.  Zuckerberg proved a good sport for responding to reams of questions from 43 senators for five hours. I commend him for admitting that Silicon Valley “is an extremely left-leaning place” and committing to “making sure that we don’t have any bias in the work that we do.”  It is critical that Facebook and other tech platforms take these realizations to heart, because surrendering their status as neutral public forum – engaging in discrimination of political viewpoints – invites government oversight and regulation of social media. This is something that nobody wants and it invites revoking the company’s immunity from liability.  The free exchange of ideas and information on the Internet over the last 25 years has produced a cultural, technological and educational revolution to rival the Wright brothers or nuclear energy. Our largest forums for that continuing exchange should do all they can to keep it a free one, unburdened by censorship or government intrusion.",partially false

8361c9d1,Canadian Govt Publishes Bid Request For “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” Needed “in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19”,"Is Canada building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit? As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing… by Mike Adams of Natural News Natural News The Canadian government, on its official acquisition website Buyandsell.gc.ca is requesting bids for “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” as part of, “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.” The listing number is 45045-190091/A, and it is found at this link: https://buyandsell.gc.ca/procurement-data/tender-notice/PW-PD-005-78707 Additional details on the bid include: Reference number: PW-$$PD-005-78707 Solicitation number: 45045-190091/A Region of delivery: National Capital Region Notice type: Notice of Proposed Procurement NPP GSIN: N7520: Office Devices and Accessories Procurement entity: Public Works and Government Services Canada The “Programmable Hydraulic Guillotines” listing on the Canadian government’s website is explained on the site as “products and services in support of Canada’s response to COVID-19.” “Guillotine” is a term that describes a mechanical device with a powerful chopping blade that can slice things apart. Although there are industrial uses for cutting devices — such as in the book publishing industry — the term “guillotine” specifically refers to a device intended to execute human beings. As the Cambridge online dictionary explains, “guillotine” is a device that’s used to kill people by cutting off their heads: Here’s an image of a paper cutting machine, which is more commonly called a “shear” or cutting machine. This is not a guillotine, even though paper cutting companies might be used as a front for acquiring actual guillotines: Antifa and left-wing BLM terrorists have recently displayed mock-up guillotines on the streets of America as part of their protest actions, demanding that the people with whom they disagree be executed via guillotine. Guillotines were also used in the French Revolution to execute political dissidents who opposed the incoming socialist regime. Canadian official asks why covid camps are being constructed in Canada, gets silenced It is difficult to imagine how guillotines would be needed to respond to COVID-19 unless Canada was building covid death camps to “process” people who refuse to submit to mass vaccinations. As it turns out, this may be exactly what Canada is doing. See this article: Canadian government erecting a network of covid detainment camps and “isolation” sites to incarcerate those who don’t cooperate with medical tyranny. As that article explains: Justin Trudeau and the Canadian government are creating Nazi Germany-like infrastructure to detain human beings en masse, and for years to come. A brave Ontario politician named Randy Hillier spoke out about the government’s nefarious detainment plan in a provincial question period in front of the government of Ontario. His microphone was cut off as soon as he started asking the tough questions. Randy Hillier, Independent Ontario MPP for Lanark, Frontenac and Kingston, stood up and questioned the government, asking how many people will be detained and how many concentration camps are scheduled for construction. He expressed concern about their current use — to control the spread of covid-19 — and pointed out in documentation that these sites could be used for “other requirements” in the future. “So your government must be in negotiations and aware of these plans to potentially detain and isolate citizens and residents of our country and our province,” Hillier began. “So speaker, to the Premier, where will these camps be built, how many people will be detained, and for what reason, for what reasons can people be kept in these isolation camps, and I’d like to have the Premier assure the people of Ontario…,” Hillier’s microphone was cut off before he could finish. See the video here, which has been banned from YouTube: Additional details on the hydraulic guillotines request from the Canadian government Solicitation document #ABES.PROD.PW__PD.B005.E78707.EBSU000 reveals additional details about the bid request: The bid document lists technical requirements for the guillotines, under a heading called “Guillotines Mandatory Requirements:” The Guillotine’s cutting and clamping systems must be fully hydraulic; The Guillotine’s automatic blade and clamp must return from every position to its original starting position; starting position; The Guillotine’s blade depth adjustments must be achievable from outside of the Guillotine; Guillotine; The Guillotine’s measurement readout must be in imperial measurement; The Guillotine’s blade changing tool, wrenches/screwdrivers and cutting block must be provided for each Guillotine; The document also calls for a “1 year parts and labour warranty” to make sure the guillotine continues running smoothly so that the chopping isn’t interrupted. Is this bid for industrial use, or something more sinister? A skeptic might look at this government bid and conclude it must be a bid for cutting equipment to be used in cutting books, stacks of papers or posters. One of the companies involved in the bid appears to be a printing company, for example. But wouldn’t that also be the perfect cover story for acquiring actual guillotines intended for a more sinister purpose? Given that Canada is already in the process of constructing covid “concentration camps” — while touting this guillotine bid as part of “Canada’s response to COVID-19,” many people will have serious questions about the intended use of these devices as well as the language used to describe them. If these were merely industrial cutting machines, wouldn’t the listing just say, “Cutting Machine” instead of “Guillotines?” And given the history of guillotines being used during radical left-wing revolutions in France, many people are wondering whether China’s corruption of modern-day Canada — including its French-speaking regions — means that China is planning to round up and execute anyone resisting communist influences in Canada. With Justin Trudeau now appearing to be a political puppet of China — much like Joe Biden — and with Chinese troops already staged in Western Canada, these are no longer idle questions. See this important story: Western Canada has already fallen to Communist China – America may have a chance, but only if it stands united. Dave Hodges of The Commonsense Show recently published an article describing plans to round up Americans and incarcerate them in Canadian concentration camps run by communist Chinese. That article explains: Steve Quayle and myself have been investigating a three-nation deal involving Communist China, Canada and the United States. The deal has now expanded to NATO forces, living in American bases that were closed during the Bush Sr., era. The CSS has also learned that their is some UN involvement as well. The agreements have to do with ridding America’s new Harris-Biden administration of any and all. Unfortunately, the interview that is presented below on this topic is a work in progress. The implications of this interview is frightening as it promises an international, state-sponsored genocidal program against “deplorables” who will oppose the real new world order. As all this is happening, Trudeau is accelerating Canada’s gun control and gun confiscation efforts to make sure that Canadian citizens have no ability to fight back when the government comes to their homes and kidnaps them, depositing them in Canada’s COVID concentration camps. Americans, on the other hand, will never give up their guns. Count on it.",false

Dorsey smashed a glass box in his office reading Break In Case Of Bad Publicity For Democrats. Inside the case was a sledgehammer for smashing Twitter's servers.  Red alert -- shut the servers down! Shut them all down!  Dorsey ran downstairs and started smashing as many computers as he could, but he did need to ask for some help, as the hammer was pretty heavy. None of the programmers could lift the hammer, either. Eventually, they managed to program a robot to pick up the sledgehammer and smash the servers.

3742c4ef,"Rep. Wingard, House Republicans to Unveil Jobs Package","by Taxpayer Association of Oregon  Rep. Matt Wingard and members of Oregon’s House Republican Caucus will shortly unveil a jobs package in anticipation of the upcoming February legislative session. According to Wingard, the series of measures would help stimulate Oregon’s lagging economy and create tens of thousands of jobs.  “Oregon’s per capita income is nine percent below the national average and getting worse. This is a state that’s actually getting poorer. My Republican colleagues and I are determined to change that trajectory.”  Wingard, who called the Legislature’s failure to pass meaningful jobs legislation the biggest disappointment of the last session, believes that the jobs package must be priority number of one in February. Specifics are still being worked out, but efforts will focus on leveraging Oregon’s vast natural resources and lowering income and capital gains taxes, among other things.  “The abundance of natural resources is the economic engine of Oregon and critical to turning our economy around,” said Wingard, noting that Oregon has lost of over 200,000 jobs during the current economic downturn. “We also have to create a climate that will encourage businesses to grow, as well as to attract other businesses to relocate to our state. “  Wingard said that House Republicans have reached out to businesses and communities around the state for ideas and to build support. The jobs package will likely encourage the responsible harvesting of trees, utilizing water resources from the Columbia River, as well attracting data centers to Oregon similar to the one recently built by Facebook in Prineville. Data centers create scores of construction jobs and add to the tax base of rural communities.",partially false

906b5aa2,Why Does Fauci Hold Patents on a Key HIV Component Used to Create COVID-19,"Why does Dr. Anthony Fauci’s name appear on 4 U.S. patents for a key glycoprotein that appears to have been inserted into a SARS virus chassis to create the current COVID-19 epidemic?  The legal portal Justia.com lists the following “patents by inventor Anthony S. Fauci” involving a glycoprotein found in the HIV-1, a disease that attacks the human immune system, leading to the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, more commonly known as AIDS. In 1990, Fauci held the same position at the NIH that he holds today. Fauci made his mark around the anti-viral medications that were developed by Big Pharma to combat the AIDS epidemic raging at that time.  This same glycoprotein, identified as Glycoprotein 120, or simply as GP120, has also been found to be a key component of the current COVID-19, a disease that appears to combine a HIV-1 attack on the human immune system, with SARS CoV-1, the pathogen from the original SARS “Severe Acute Respiratory System” that created an international pandemic in 2002-2003. The pathogen in COVID-19 is named SARS CoV-2 in medical scientific literature.  The four patents on which Fauci is named as an inventor are the following:  Patent Number: 9896509, patent granted August 3, 2016. “Use of antagonists of the interaction between HIV120 and ?4?7 integrin.  Publication Number: 20160333309, patent application filed August 3, 2016. “Use of Antagonists of the Interaction Between HIV GP120 and A4B7 Integrin.  Patent Number: 9441041, patent granted September 13, 2016. “Use of antagonists between HIV GP120 and ?4?7 integrin.”  Publication Number 2016007586, patent application filed September 21, 2015. “Use of antagonists of the Interaction Between HIV GP120 and A4B7 Integrin.”  An article published by a group of medical scientists in India in the medical science journal BioRXiv in January 2020 was entitled “Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019-nCov spike protein to HIV-1 and Gag.”  In a highly controversial finding, the medical scientists in India reported: “We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein S which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-Gag, all of which have identity/similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.”  The article almost immediately was withdrawn after disinformation experts recognized the medical scientists in India were suggesting that COVID-19 was created by inserting the particular glycoprotein from the HIV-1 disease that involve patents held by or applied for by Fauci. Even more upsetting to disinformation operatives was the suggestion that the insertion of these 4 inserts into a SARS virus is not likely to occur in nature.  The clear suggestion was that COVID-19 was laboratory-created, possibly as a bioweapon, and that the creator of the virus used GP120 to do so, a glycoprotein from the HIV-1 1990s era that tied back to Fauci.",false
b906fccf,Pro-Life Groups Upset UN Coronavirus Relief Funds Can Promote Abortions in Ecuador,"The United Nations is using coronavirus aid to fund abortions in Ecuador, pro-life leaders in the country claim. The Catholic News Agency reports the country’s Ministry of Foreign Relations and Human Mobility recently asked for $46.4 million in aid from the UN Humanitarian Response Plan COVID-19. Within that UN funding package, however, is a goal to “maintain continuity of maternal, neonatal and children’s health and other sexual and reproductive health services during the pandemic,” including abortions, according to the report. “[Our] fear is that our highest authority in Ecuador will even consider accepting this economic shakedown of $46 million in exchange for the lives of thousands of unborn children,” Martha Villafuerte of the pro-life Guayaquil Family Network told ACI Prensa. The Guayaquil Family Network and other pro-life organizations recently began a petition urging President Lenin Moreno to reject the abortion agenda within the aid, according to the report. “It goes against the Constitution, specifically article 45, which guarantees the right to life from conception, a right that was ratified last September 17 at the plenary session of the National Assembly,” Villafuerte said. HELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation! Villafuerte said the UN plan would give Ecuador $46.4 million, but $3 million of that aid would be used to train “health personnel on safe, legal abortion and post-abortion care.” Some lawmakers are speaking out against the abortion agenda, too. “Unbelievable! The UN conditions ‘safe legal abortion’ in its humanitarian support plan for Ecuador,” Assemblyman Héctor Yépez wrote on Twitter. “While we all want to save lives, some insist on eliminating the lives of unborn girls and boys.” UPDATE 5/26/20: The Ecuadorian government has assured Yépez that funds would not be used to legalize abortions and would only be spent in accordance with current laws. In statements to ACI Prensa, legislator Yépez referred to the Foreign Ministry’s response. “The objective of preventing them from executing what the UN wanted, which was an attempt to advance abortion, was achieved, but now they come out with a pun to wash their faces, in which they say that they were only referring to what it was already established in the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code ”. “I think the objective has been met, having discovered the intent, and with this letter they themselves are ensuring that they are not going to execute anything outside of what the law says in Ecuador, which is what we were looking for,” he stressed. However, Yépez urged “to remain very vigilant so that the COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Plan is not distorted.” The United Nations has faced prior international criticism for pushing abortions as part of its response to the coronavirus. Jonathan Abbamonte of the Population Research Institute wrote more about it earlier this month: The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA has also been urging governments to ensure uninterrupted access to abortion during the pandemic. An interim technical brief recently issued by UNFPA calls on governments to: “Ensure women’s and girls’ choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health is respected regardless of their COVID-19 status, including access to contraception, emergency contraception, safe abortion to the full extent of the law.” The technical brief also advises governments to “encourage” women who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection to seek abortion services “to the full extent of the law.” This seems a backhanded way of saying that, when women come to African health clinics to be treated for the coronavirus, they should also be propagandized about the benefits of abortion. Health care in Africa has often been directly tied to population control programs in this way. The WHO also faced heavy criticism from pro-life leaders this spring when it falsely claimed abortion is an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic. President Donald Trump stopped giving United States tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund in 2017, and, in April, he halted funding to the World Health Organization WHO.

7bc541e6,Blaylock: Face Masks Pose Serious Risks To The Healthy,"Please Share This Story! Dr. Russell Blaylock warns that not only do face masks fail to protect the healthy from getting sick, but they also create serious health risks to the wearer. The bottom line is that if you are not sick, you should not wear a face mask. As businesses reopen, many are requiring shoppers and employees to wear a face mask. Costco, for instance, will not allow shoppers into the store without wearing a face mask. Many employers are requiring all employees to wear a face mask while at work. In some jurisdictions, all citizens must wear a face mask if they are outside of their own home. ⁃ TN Editor With the advent of the so-called COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen a number of medical practices that have little or no scientific support as regards reducing the spread of this infection. One of these measures is the wearing of facial masks, either a surgical-type mask, bandana or N95 respirator mask. When this pandemic began and we knew little about the virus itself or its epidemiologic behavior, it was assumed that it would behave, in terms of spread among communities, like other respiratory viruses. Little has presented itself after intense study of this virus and its behavior to change this perception. This is somewhat of an unusual virus in that for the vast majority of people infected by the virus, one experiences either no illness asymptomatic or very little sickness. Only a very small number of people are at risk of a potentially serious outcome from the infection—mainly those with underlying serious medical conditions in conjunction with advanced age and frailty, those with immune compromising conditions and nursing home patients near the end of their lives. There is growing evidence that the treatment protocol issued to treating doctors by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC, mainly intubation and use of a ventilator respirator, may have contributed significantly to the high death rate in these select individuals. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain. Russell Blaylock, MD As for the scientific support for the use of face mask, a recent careful examination of the literature, in which 17 of the best studies were analyzed, concluded that, “ None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”1 Keep in mind, no studies have been done to demonstrate that either a cloth mask or the N95 mask has any effect on transmission of the COVID-19 virus. Any recommendations, therefore, have to be based on studies of influenza virus transmission. And, as you have seen, there is no conclusive evidence of their efficiency in controlling flu virus transmission. It is also instructive to know that until recently, the CDC did not recommend wearing a face mask or covering of any kind, unless a person was known to be infected, that is, until recently. Non-infected people need not wear a mask. When a person has TB we have them wear a mask, not the entire community of non-infected. The recommendations by the CDC and the WHO are not based on any studies of this virus and have never been used to contain any other virus pandemic or epidemic in history. Now that we have established that there is no scientific evidence necessitating the wearing of a face mask for prevention, are there dangers to wearing a face mask, especially for long periods? Several studies have indeed found significant problems with wearing such a mask. This can vary from headaches, to increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, to hypoxia, all the way to serious life-threatening complications. There is a difference between the N95 respirator mask and the surgical mask cloth or paper mask in terms of side effects. The N95 mask, which filters out 95% of particles with a median diameter >0.3 µm2 , because it impairs respiratory exchange breathing to a greater degree than a soft mask, and is more often associated with headaches. In one such study, researchers surveyed 212 healthcare workers 47 males and 165 females asking about presence of headaches with N95 mask use, duration of the headaches, type of headaches and if the person had preexisting headaches.2 How is Coronavirus Getting Into the Brain? Vaccine Reaction They found that about a third of the workers developed headaches with use of the mask, most had preexisting headaches that were worsened by the mask wearing, and 60% required pain medications for relief. As to the cause of the headaches, while straps and pressure from the mask could be causative, the bulk of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. That is, a reduction in blood oxygenation hypoxia or an elevation in blood C02 hypercapnia. It is known that the N95 mask, if worn for hours, can reduce blood oxygenation as much as 20%, which can lead to a loss of consciousness, as happened to the hapless fellow driving around alone in his car wearing an N95 mask, causing him to pass out, and to crash his car and sustain injuries. I am sure that we have several cases of elderly individuals or any person with poor lung function passing out, hitting their head. This, of course, can lead to death. A more recent study involving 159 healthcare workers aged 21 to 35 years of age found that 81% developed headaches from wearing a face mask.3 Some had pre-existing headaches that were precipitated by the masks. All felt like the headaches affected their work performance. Unfortunately, no one is telling the frail elderly and those with lung diseases, such as COPD, emphysema or pulmonary fibrosis, of these dangers when wearing a facial mask of any kind—which can cause a severe worsening of lung function. This also includes lung cancer patients and people having had lung surgery, especially with partial resection or even the removal of a whole lung. While most agree that the N95 mask can cause significant hypoxia and hypercapnia, another study of surgical masks found significant reductions in blood oxygen as well. In this study, researchers examined the blood oxygen levels in 53 surgeons using an oximeter. They measured blood oxygenation before surgery as well as at the end of surgeries.4 The researchers found that the mask reduced the blood oxygen levels pa02 significantly. The longer the duration of wearing the mask, the greater the fall in blood oxygen levels. The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels hypoxia is associated with an impairment in immunity. Studies have shown that hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections called the CD4+ T-lymphocyte. This occurs because the hypoxia increases the level of a compound called hypoxia inducible factor-1 HIF-1, which inhibits T-lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell called the Tregs. . This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID-19 and making the consequences of that infection much graver. In essence, your mask may very well put you at an increased risk of infections and if so, having a much worse outcome.5,6,7 People with cancer, especially if the cancer has spread, will be at a further risk from prolonged hypoxia as the cancer grows best in a microenvironment that is low in oxygen. Low oxygen also promotes inflammation which can promote the growth, invasion and spread of cancers.8,9 Repeated episodes of hypoxia has been proposed as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and hence increases all cardiovascular heart attacks and cerebrovascular strokes diseases.10 There is another danger to wearing these masks on a daily basis, especially if worn for several hours. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they will expel some of the virus with each breath. If they are wearing a mask, especially an N95 mask or other tightly fitting mask, they will be constantly rebreathing the viruses, raising the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. We know that people who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. And this leads to the deadly cytokine storm in a selected number. It gets even more frightening. Newer evidence suggests that in some cases the virus can enter the brain.11,12 In most instances it enters the brain by way of the olfactory nerves smell nerves, which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves and travel into the brain.13 It is evident from this review that there is insufficient evidence that wearing a mask of any kind can have a significant impact in preventing the spread of this virus. The fact that this virus is a relatively benign infection for the vast majority of the population and that most of the at-risk group also survive, from an infectious disease and epidemiological standpoint, by letting the virus spread through the healthier population we will reach a herd immunity level rather quickly that will end this pandemic quickly and prevent a return next winter. During this time, we need to protect the at-risk population by avoiding close contact, boosting their immunity with compounds that boost cellular immunity and in general, care for them.

6115b616,Vladimir Putin Reveals: The West Is Controlled By Satanic Pedophiles,"Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken out against the epidemic of pedophile networks that have taken over the United States, UK, and other Western nations. Despite his recent successful unity with President Trump, he remains firm on his original stance that culture in the West is being manipulated by .Prior to his recent meeting with Donald Trump at this years G20 Summit, Putin issued a warning that if he didn't expose the Elite pedophile networks, then he would . Although the historic meeting was regarded by both parties as a success, with promising resolutions on the Syrian conflict and hacking allegations, Mr. Putin's position on the matter of child-abusing Elites remains the same, saying:Looking forward following his meeting with Mr. Trump though, Putin said they had set the scene for a new era of cooperation describing their talk as a  and a President Putin has previous highlighted Satanism and pedophilia as one of the main challenges facing contemporary Russia. In a display of candor at the Valdai International Discussion Club, Putin described the  as a clear sign of . Putin observed that  were overlooking the fact that military-political problems and general social conditions are worsening, with much of the world forgetting the value of basic human decency. Focusing on the challenges faced by Russia in an international context on both foreign policy and moral flavor, Putin alluded to Satanism which he has known for a long time to be responsible for rotting the fabric of America at the core:GFM reports : This is an astonishing comment coming from a world leader when Westerners and Europeans are accustomed to a combination of mere propaganda, rosy political rhetoric, and stock  which typically reveals nothing and obscures reality by design. Putin wasn't done though, adding:Another bombshell that should reverberate in the numbed minds of  Europeans and fluoridated Westerners.How many other world leaders have spoken out about the insidious and increasingly widespread normalization and promotion of pedophilia? Did Obama order mass pedophile arrests? Did either Clinton? Did either of the Bushs do or say anything meaningful about the pedophilia epidemic? No. Have you considered that they may be tooin keeping it quiet? Doubtless that Putin would applaud the efforts of President Trump in organizing for the arrest of some 1,500 pedophiles on American soil within a matter of weeks of arriving in the Whitehouse. Where were the  and  when that went down? Still crying about Hillary? In late 2012 with Obama still in office, Putin actually passed a controversial bill with emphatic support from the State Duma to ban US foster parents from adopting Russian children in a move that will simultaneously protect a number of them from being shunted into child trafficking operations while also tragically denying many orphans new families. America adopts more Russian children annually than any other nation.Putin explained  for the abuse of Russian children at the hands of American pedophiles. Reportedly, the Russian premier has warned that the ban will remain until President Trump takes care of the sex trafficking epidemic and lives up to his promise to  of pedophile Elites in Washington D.C. It appears likely that an elite pedophile network in D.C. uses adoption to enter children into child sex trafficking – hardly news considering the well-known saturation of pedophiles within America's political machinery. Further addressing the worsening moral crisis, Putin offered criticism of the erosion of traditional religion and its moral foundations, and an implicit derision of  and it's less talked about insidious effects:The  explicitly criticized contemporary forms of , calling it  It is not a well known fact at all that the current contrived and forced brand of  so many of us have come to know, is part of the Zionist design for achieving full spectrum global domination in this case through deliberately subverting a nation's cultural integrity and identity – multiculturalism as a sort of Trojan horse. Not least of all in Putin's speech was a broad allusion to and scathing critique of the New World Order a.k.a. One World Government Zio-globalist agenda, which amounts to global slavery, as Putin himself explains:It is evident that with Obama's exit from the Oval Office and Trump's entrance, Russia and America have more in common now than recent memory attains. For one thing, we could never have expected such overt mutual US-Russian opposition to the entrenched pedophile networks operating throughout Western politics and societies in general. Perhaps we will see the  network of pedophiles and Satanists get their comeuppance in this lifetime after all.",false
7db350af,Two candidates bid to break through Georgia’s ‘lavender ceiling’,"November 8, 2016. That's the next possible date for another LGBT barrier to be broken in Georgia—getting an openly gay man elected to the state legislature. Roughly a dozen have tried and failed in the last decade, with three going down last November Rashad Taylor came out while in office in 2011, but subsequently lost in his 2012 bid for re-election. Up next to try are Rafer Johnson and Josh Noblitt.  Johnson, a flight attendant at Delta Air Lines and a community advocate, announced his bid for the House District 62 seat in April. But it wasn't the first time he's considered running for office.  A few years ago he went through campaign training with the Gay & Lesbian Victory Fund, a political action committee dedicated to getting openly LGBT people elected to public office. A seat opened on the Fulton County Commission after that, but he passed on running.  When state Rep. Ladawn Blackett Jones D-Atlanta announced earlier this year that she would not be running again for the HD62 seat in 2016, Johnson started encouraging others to run, but they told him he should do it instead. Johnson says he told his husband, Kelly Johnson, a board member with Georgia Equality, about the responses, and Kelly pulled out an application to run for the seat that was already filled out.  “He told me, 'We've all been discussing this, we've just been waiting for you to get to the answer,'” says Johnson, who is making economic growth the centerpiece of his campaign.  He is no stranger to public service, having served as the chair of Fulton County's Housing Authority, national co-chair of the Black Gay Men's Network and as a board member for Atlanta Pride.  Johnson laments the fact that no openly gay man has been elected to the legislature, saying, “We've got to break that lavender ceiling so that we have the best and the brightest serving the entire state.”  But he sees Georgia as being in the midst of a transition on LGBT issues. Voters will decide whether he's right next November.  Public safety centerpiece of hate crime victim Noblitt's campaign  Some say a higher power might be needed to get an openly gay man elected to the Georgia legislature. Enter Josh Noblitt, the openly gay Minister of Social Justice at Saint Mark United Methodist Church, who announced his candidacy for the House District 59 seat in May.  Noblitt is close with the current holder of the seat, state Rep. Margaret Kaiser D-Atlanta, and has even shadowed her two or three times each legislative session over the last few years. When Kaiser announced in March that she would forego a 2016 reelection effort and instead make a run for mayor in 2017, Noblitt stepped in to announce his run.  Citing his position as president of his neighborhood association and as vice chair of his neighborhood planning unit, Noblitt says, “I've just really enjoyed that level of civic engagement and it just felt like a really logical next step for me.”  Noblitt made headlines in 2010 after being attacked at gunpoint along with his then-partner in an anti-gay hate crime in Piedmont Park. The attack eventually led to the formation of an Atlanta Police LGBT Advisory Board, of which Noblitt was a member. The board, however, has fallen off in recent years.  He's making public safety the centerpiece of his campaign, citing his “unique interaction with the criminal justice system” considering his role as a victim in the hate crime, his previous work in the Georgia Public Defender's Office and current role as chaplain for the Atlanta Police Department.  “Having those three unique perspectives and also being the president of my neighborhood association and hearing complaints from neighbors around public safety issues, I feel like I have a lot to bring to the table around that particular issue,” says Noblitt, who has raised just over $30,000 as of a June 30 campaign finance report.  In recent years, Noblitt has been an outspoken advocate for LGBT equality, speaking at numerous marriage equality rallies as well as at many rallies opposing Georgia’s so-called “religious freedom” bill.  He doesn't know why an openly gay man has yet to be elected to the legislature, saying it's hard to compare his election with previous elections since all have been in different districts with different demographics and candidates; but he remains hopeful.  “The times are very different even from one year ago. We've got marriage equality, we've got the end of DOMA [Defense of Marriage Act], we've got all kinds of advancements happening in a way that's changing hearts and minds of folks around LGBT issues.”  The Candidates  Rafer Johnson  House District 62, which includes portions of College Park, Douglasville, East Point and unincorporated portions of Fulton and Douglas counties.  Josh Noblitt  House District 59, which includes the neighborhoods of Poncey-Highland, Little Five Points, Inman Park, Reynoldstown, North Ormewood Park, Glenwood Park, Ormewood Park, Boulevard Heights, Grant Park, The Villages at Carver, South Atlanta, Lakewood Heights, Polar Rock, Perkerson Park, East Point, Colonial Hills, Frog Hollow, Conley Hills, Semmes Park, Fort Valley and Greenbriar.

c460b4ee,PROOF: The Novel Coronavirus Infecting the World is a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army,"Nation  PROOF: The Novel Coronavirus Infecting the World is a MILITARY BIO-WEAPON Developed by China's Army  The novel Coronavirus outbreak affecting China and many other countries right now, has been determined to be a military BIO-WEAPON, which was being worked on at the Wuhan Virology Laboratory by China's People's Liberation Army, Nanjiang Command. Somehow, it got out. The world is now facing a massive wipe-out of humanity as a result.  The proof that this virus is a genetically-modified Bat-SARS-Like Virus, manipulated by the Chinese Army, appears below. The evidence is irrefutable.  Two separate components of genetic sequencing from HIV-1, the virus which causes AIDS, were added to Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus in the laboratory, thereby allowing it to infect human lungs via the ACES2 receptors in our lungs, and to disrupt the human body ability to fight it off, by reducing human leukocytes.  BIO-WEAPON PROOF  Make no mistake: this disease is, in fact, a MILITARY biological weapon. The disease sequence from the original Bat coronavirus was uploaded to the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the US National Library of Medicine, in the year 2018 by China's Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjing Command. The image below from the National Center for Biotechnology Information proves the upload Click image to enlarge:  That Bat-SARS-Like coronavirus was issued Reference ID: AVP 70833.1 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the U.S. Library of Medicine.  The present outbreak of novel Coronavirus was uploaded to that same National Center for Biotechnology Information in January of this year by the Shanghai Public Heath Clinical Center and was issued Reference ID: QHD3418.1. Here is proof of THAT upload Click image to enlarge:  Using the test facilities known as BLAST Basic Local Alignment Search Tool from the U.S. National Library of Medicine researchers have determined that the virus envelope of those two separate diseases, are 100% identical! Here is the BLAST Test result Click image to enlarge:  MORE: a new study shows that elements of HIV have been found in the new novel coronavirus! From that study:  We are currently witnessing a major epidemic caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus 2019- nCoV. The evolution of 2019-nCoV remains elusive. We found 4 insertions in the spike glycoprotein S which are unique to the 2019-nCoV and are not present in other coronaviruses. Importantly, amino acid residues in all the 4 inserts have identity or similarity to those in the HIV-1 gp120 or HIV-1 Gag. Interestingly, despite the inserts being discontinuous on the primary amino acid sequence, 3D-modelling of the 2019-nCoV suggests that they converge to constitute the receptor binding site. The finding of 4 unique inserts in the 2019-nCoV, all of which have identity /similarity to amino acid residues in key structural proteins of HIV-1 is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature.  LINK TO STUDY HERE  There is no way in nature that the Bat coronavirus could fortuitously acquire the HIV genetic sequences, without causing a mutation of the Virus Envelope. The ONLY way the virus envelope could obtain the HIV genetics and still remain 100% identical to the 2018 sample, is if the HIV genes were added in a laboratory.  So what the human race is now facing, is an accidentally-released military bio-weapon. The original Bat-SARS-Like Coronavirus was identified by China's People's Liberation Army, through the Institute of Military Medicine, Nanjiang Command in the year 2018. They uploaded the virus sequence and they were the sole entity in possession of the virus.  Here we are, two years later, and the virus they had has been changed in a way that cannot occur in nature without mutating the virus envelope protein.  This isn't rocket science; this is as plain as day. China conducted genetic manipulation of their Bat-SARS-like virus and created a new virus capable of infecting humans. That new virus was apparently accidentally-released and is the novel coronavirus the world is now battling.  I am sorry to have to report, many of us are very likely to LOSE this battle. Just like many are already losing their battle inside China and elsewhere.  QUARANTINE  Within the first month of this outbreak in China, the government there effectively QUARANTINED more than fifty-six MILLION people 56,000,000 in nineteen 19 major cities, even though China reported publicly that only a few hundred were infected and only about 25 had died by that time.  WHY?  Why would China lockdown 19 cities and effectively Quarantine 56 Million people for such a trivial disease? Because China KNEW it wasn't trivial. China KNEW it was a military bio-weapon which had accidentally gotten out. And China also KNEW how far this would spread and how fast. China is guilty as sin.  DISEASE FACTS:  Here are the now-established FACTS about this disease:  This disease has an eighty-three percent 83% infection rate. That means if 100 people are EXPOSED to this virus, 83 WILL get sick from it.  The Disease can spread by AIR. It is HIGHLY, HIGHLY contagious.  When a person breathes, virus comes out with those breaths. Same thing when a person sneezes or coughs. Same when urinating or having a bowel movement. ALL OF IT HAS VIRUS IN IT.  The virus can live OUTSIDE a person, in the air or on a surface, for a minimum of five days, and a maximum of twenty eight days.  So if an infected person goes into a store or supermarket, or public bathroom, or a school, office, warehouse . . . . or anywhere . . . . touches products on shelves and puts anything back, or sneezes or coughs, his virus gets on the products in that store or supermarket, bathroom, school, office, warehouse, etc., and can survive.  YOU walk-in a couple minutes, hours or even DAYS later, and pick up the same item, or even smell their stink in the bathroom - POW, you're infected.  WORSE: This virus can infect others through the eyes and ears.  Let's say you're walking inside somewhere and an infected person was there minutes earlier and coughed or sneezed. The cough or sneeze threw microscopic droplets into the air, which float for awhile. A few minutes later, you walk through that air. One or more of the microscopic droplets gets on your eye. You don't even KNOW it because the things are so small.  You blink. We all blink.  Your eye lid pushes the virus off the surface of your eye, down into the bottom eye area, and the virus washes down into your tear duct. POW- you're infected.  It cannot be overstated that this virus is the worst public disease crisis the world has faced in over 100 years. Not since the Spanish Flu of 1918 has the world faced such death and this is already heading toward being far WORSE than the Spanish Flu.  The Spanish Flu spread worldwide during 1918-1919. In the United States, it was first identified in military personnel in spring 1918. It is estimated that about 500 million people or one-third of the world’s population became infected with this virus. The number of deaths was estimated to be at least 50 million worldwide with about 675,000 occurring in the United States.  When a disease outbreak occurs, one of the measurements that scientists use to see how badly the disease will spread is known as R 0.  The 1918-1919 pandemic-causing Spanish flu is estimated to have had an R 0 ranging from 1.4 – 2.8, with a mean of 2. This means that for every person infected, that person could be expected to infect another 1.4 to 2.8 additional people.  I regret to report that the R 0 of this Bio-Weapon is already showing itself to be R4.08 . . . FAAAAAAR Worse than the 1918 Spanish Flu.  Here's where things get very bad, very fast.  According to Satistia, the number of all hospital beds in the U.S. 1975-2017, is decreasing. In 1975, there were about 1.5 million hospital beds in the U.S., but until 2017 the number dropped to just about 931 thousand. Aug 9, 2019 HERE  According to TrendingEconomics, Hospital beds per 1,000 people in United States was reported at 2.9 in 2013, according to the World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially recognized sources. Hospital beds include inpatient beds available in public, private, general, and specialized hospitals and rehabilitation centers. Here  Using the Infection Rate of 83% listed above, out of 1,000 people exposed to this Bio-Weapon, 830 will become infected.  There are 2.9 Hospital beds per thousand US citizens. So when 830 people get infected, how many can those 2.9 hospital beds hold??????? Yea. 2.9  What happens to the rest? They cannot get hospital care.  Right now, when a person cannot get hospital care for this disease, the death rate for such people is 65-70%.  That means me and you. Dead.  IT CAN AND PROBABLY WILL HAPPEN HERE  Many of the 56 Million people in 19 Quarantined cities have not eaten in days because there is no food remaining in the cities. This is causing rioting.  Delivery trucks are prohibited from entering these contaminated cities, for fear of spreading the Coronavirus to outlying areas. People are literally FIGHTING each other to get food:  People are trying virtually anything they can to ESCAPE the quarantine, to get food:  Roadblocks erected by bulldozers, bucket loaders and backhoes, consisting of large piles of dirt, rocks, and other obstructions, now appear on most roads into and out of Quarantined cities.  Some of these barriers were erected by government while others were erected by people in small towns and villages to keep the infected OUT.  In the meantime, people throughout China are still simply DROPPING DEAD in their tracks:  In Shopping Malls:  On the public streets:  All over the public street:  In other places, people are engaging in fist fights to get their hands on Filter Masks:  People in some areas are attacking others for merely COMING IN to their neighborhood; WARNING: People hit in head with PIPES:  Those who are not dropping dead, are literally fighting each other for food:  Meanwhile, the lines to just get IN to a hospital are . . . . unimaginable:  OUTSIDE CHINA, people are also dropping dead from this virus.  In Mexico, this poor man waited far too long, until the disease became Hemorrhagic; THIS is how this disease ends GRAPHIC:  Things inside China are getting so bad, Police are now BOARDING-UP People inside their apartments to KEEP THEM IN!  And MORE people Nailed-in to their own homes:  And once the police leave, other people are coming and SETTING THE HOMES ON FIRE to burn the infected people to death!  CHINA ORDERS ALL PETS KILLED  Residential committees, village officials and companies from various provinces and municipalities issued a strict order to locals after receiving instructions from their superiors to tackle the epidemic, it has emerged. They have ordered citizens to get rid of their pets or face having them culled.  One village in Hebei urged all households to 'deal with' their pets within five days, otherwise officials would 'handle' them altogether; while another residential committee in Shaanxi instructed people to 'consider the overall situation' and dispose of their cats and dogs immediately.  China says pets can carry the bio-weapon virus and spread it to others.  China is only about 30 Days into this outbreak, and their entire country and society are already collapsing. What you see above OVER THERE, is just 30 days away from happening OVER HERE.  Are you preparing?  Bear in mind that all this is just ONE MONTH into the outbreak. ONE MONTH!  What we see happening in China, can -- and very likely WILL -- happen here, in America.  Today Saturday February 1 A California man has tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the seventh confirmed case in the United States.    The unidentified man is a resident of Santa Clara County, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday afternoon, according to local news reports.    Health officials have documented two other cases in California; two in Illinois; one in Arizona and one in Washington state.  UPDATE 4:43 PM EST -- The eighth confirmed US case of the coronavirus is in a man in his 20s who lives in Boston, according to a press release from Boston and Massachusetts health officials. The man recently returned from Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak.  Yesterday, The Hal Turner Radio Show was told that Presbyterian Hospital in Pittsburgh had a patient who tested positive for Corona Virus, who had been in the city for over a week, doing business. The source reported that federal government people came and took the patient away, then FORCED Nurses, Doctors and Staff to sign Non-Disclosure Agreements which threatened them with criminal prosecution and prison, if they revealed anything about the existence of this patient to anyone!  Thus, the American people must now start to wonder whether other Doctors, Nurses, and health care providers are being intimidated into staying silent too? FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS, MOST FOLKS DO NOT BELIEVE THE OFFICIAL NUMBERS REGARDING THE NUMBER OF INFECTED OR THE NUMBER OF DEATHS.  Most people who have been following this situation closely say they think we are smack dab in the middle of a global cover-up.    You don't:  - Quarantine around 65 million people figures vary, but multiple large cities in China are involved  - Stop people traveling on highways to check their temperatures  - Extend the Lunar New Year holiday so people don't go back to work  - Delay the start of spring semester classes  - Shut down the stock market    All because 259 people have died. The actions taken by not only China, but by dozens of other countries around the globe, are not a logical response to 259 fatalities.  The best way to avoid this is to protect yourself and your family. Here's how:  HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF  The Medical Infrastructure of the United States and pretty much every other country simply CANNOT HANDLE THIS from the perspective of how many get infected and how fast that happens. There simply are not enough hospital beds, respirators, negative-pressure infectious disease isolation rooms. Once the virus gets here in earnest it probably already is but we won't know for ten days the medical system will be quickly overwhelmed. We could see Medical Infrastructure COLLAPSE here in the USA the same as it is happening in China.  When things go wild weasel here in America, there will be all sorts of unanticipated service disruptions.  The general public remains blissfully unaware of the utter disaster coming at us, because the mass-media is keeping rather quiet about the situation. But when they can't keep quiet any longer, there will be PANIC.  You should PREPARE NOW because once the SHTF, it will be too late.  Here are suggested Preps to try to get yourself and your family through what's coming. There is precious little time left . . .  The best strategy for this is NOT to be exposed. Fat chance of that; we ALL go out: Work, school, shopping, recreation, and so forth.  So how might we protect ourselves while we're out?  Well, the fact this virus can be spread by air, in addition to staying alive on surfaces like counter tops, desks, water fountains, door handles, inside cars and buses, product packages on store shelves that someone else handled, or sneezed-on or coughed-on, - including ones that get delivered by mail, FedEx, UPS, etc. -- complicates things greatly.  Step One: Stay home. Do not go out unless you absolutely MUST.  Step Two: Presuming you have to go out we ALL do wear a filter mask eye and hand protective gear below.  The N-95 filter masks are almost completely sold out already, nationwide. So you can get a better mask rated as N-100 or P-100 for the time being until THEY sell out. Links to various suppliers are HERE-N-95 and HERE N-100. I am NOT the seller  You can also get the VASTLY AVAILABLE 3M 7500 HERE which uses 3M 2091 filters HERE This mask system is more expensive, but it works and is widely still available. Again, I am NOT the seller  Get Eye Protection, either cheap swimmer goggles HERE or better safety goggles HERE  Get a box of rubber/nitrile Gloves Here  Wear this gear when you go out.  Yes, you'll look and feel ridiculous. But you are much more likely to have the last laugh because YOU are protecting yourself.  THIS IS URGENTLY IMPORTANT:  The absolute moment you get home, take off your shoes and leave them in the foyer. DO NOT WALK AROUND YOUR HOUSE IN SHOES YOU WORE OUTSIDE.  You may have walked on a large amount of infected material as you were out and if you wear those shoes in the house, the virus will spread in the house.  Next: Go into the bathroom, take off your clothing, put it in a hamper or plastic bag, and take a shower. You HAVE TO WASH OFF any virus that may have landed on your body or hair, while you were out.  Put on clean garments. You cannot go sit in your chair or lay on your couch or bed in clothing you wore outside. The virus will come off the clothing, onto the furniture and pow, someone in the house catches it.  Make every person in your household do this the absolute moment they come home. This virus is HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS and it KILLS people. We cannot skimp or get lazy protecting ourselves.  Eat right, take vitamins I use Centrum, and, I don't want to sound hokey, or like some Bible thumper, pray to Almighty God that you be protected by Him during this crisis. I'm not kidding. I mean it: PRAY.  Even if you haven't prayed in decades, start now. Hi God, it's me so and so. I know I haven't prayed to you in a long time, but I'm coming back to you now. . . . .  And then talk honestly and earnestly to him, in a very quiet voice.  Just remember, this is God, not a magician to be summoned to do tricks or render services at our beckon call. He made us. We are HIS to do with a HE sees fit.  OTHER PREPS with Links  Have Emergency food HERE, HERE, and HERE in the house in case Quarantine gets implemented, so you and your family can eat for the 6 weeks or so such Quarantines are likely to last.  Have Emergency Water HERE stored up in case the water supply gets contaminated.  Here is a complete list of Preps that folks might consider for themselves.  Please pass this article along to those you care about; No other source is providing this type of self-help advice and there isn't much time left before all hell breaks loose.  UPDATE SUNDAY 10:15 AM EST --  CHINA PUBLICLY DENIES THIS STORY  Chinese experts on Sunday denied rumors that the novel #coronavirus originated from lab-grown samples. Shi Zhengli, Chinese virologist and researcher at the #Wuhan Institute of Virology, said the outbreak was due to improper lifestyle choices rather than sample leaks from a lab. pic.twitter.com/zO4q2JZEeR — People's Daily, China @PDChina February 2, 2020  China is now publicly DENYING the virus outbreak was caused by a leaked virus from the Wuhan Virology lab. Yet the proof above about them having this exact virus, and the 100% genetic envelope match, gives LIE to China's denial. MOREOVER, that precise lab, even published a scientific paper on Combining BAT-SARS-like Virus with inserts from HIV to make it MORE INFECTIOUS. That scientific paper is HERE for all to read.  Now, I ask you, is it more likely their Frankenstein-type Virus got out, or that some people lived lifestyles which caused the EXACT same illness?  Sorry China, your lab lost this virus into the public and now you're trying to save face by shifting blame. Nobody believes you.

b7db0e10,14 Generals Say They Will Never Take Orders From Joe Biden,"Joe Biden won’t be receiving the warm welcome he had hoped for, according to sources close to the Pentagon.  14 generals with a lot of clout have come forward to say that they absolutely will not follow Joe Biden’s orders, no matter what.  These brave men, who include two women and one undecided, say that following the orders of a man like Biden isn’t something they’re willing to do.  One of the generals told Washington Military Daily that there was “no way” he was going to do anything Biden said. The others had similar sentiments, although a couple offered a little clarification.  According to a memo released from the office of General Joe Barron:  “I cannot in good conscience follow orders from Joe Biden. Not because I don’t like him or disagree with his policies, but because I retired 10 years ago. Who the hell is writing this stupid article? All of the people on the list are retired. None of them follow orders from anyone anymore. They’re civilians.”  And there you have it, Patriots. Not one of the 14 generals will bother to listen to Biden at all.  We don’t feel as though the reason is really that relevant, so just never mind. They all said no, and that’s what we’re running with.  Just how the heck does he think he’s gonna run a country if men like these refuse to take orders?  Our military expert, Art Tubolls, says it’s going to be an uphill battle:  “Getting them to listen to orders may be tough. 11 of them are in assisted living facilities, and 4 don’t have any idea who they are — or who Joe Biden is for that matter. “How is the next president going to deal with it? Some say he’ll have a hard time. Others say he’ll focus on active generals who aren’t retired. “Basically, it’s just a big mess.”  One thing is for sure, patriots. Without the support of generals, whether they’re drooling in a cup or not, Biden is destined to fail.",false
c06b7d1a,"George Soros ARRESTED for election interference, in federal custody – Conservative Beaver","PHILADELPHIA – George Soros has been arrested, and is currently in federal custody in Philadelphia. According to a recently unsealed indictment filed in the West District of Pennsylvania, Soros committed a slew of serious crimes prior to the US election.  The indictment focuses only on the criminal activity Soros participated in prior to the election, such as wire fraud, identity theft, and damage to computers.  The FBI stated that the indictment will likely be updated to reflect election interference charges in relation to Dominion Voting, once the full scale of Soros’ operations is known. Soros is currently being interrogated by the FBI.  It also notable that the judge put a publication ban on Soros’ arrest, however, those laws don’t apply to Canadian Media – like the Conservative Beaver.  Rebel News – a renowned alternative media outlet – previously reported on the connection between George Soros, the Tides Foundation, and Dominion Voting.  According to reporter Keean Bexte,  Dominion Voting has come under fire after their vote tabulation machines created a 6,000 vote swing in a single Michigan state county. The same machines and software were used in every single county in Georgia and in several other swing states that just sent their electoral votes to Joe Biden for now.  Bexte has provided evidence that suggests George Soros may have had a bigger role in the election than previously thought.  The FBI have confirmed they are aware of Soros’ operations in Canada, and have executed a search warrant on Soros’ home and offices in Toronto.  Some have speculated Soros may have rigged Canada’s recent election in Trudeau’s favour.  Check out Dominion voting machines and smartmatic software. I doubt that Trudeau even managed to achieve a minority of the vote in the last election.

39c5f41b,Ocasio-Cortez Proposes Bill Capping Legal Voting Age at 65,"The Democrats in Congress just never seem to be satisfied. After the months of phony “impeachment” nonsense they put us all through, paid for by dipping into our social security funding, no less, now they’re dead set to cheat their way through the 2020 election. And who better to lead the crooked bandwagon than Little Sally Socialism herself, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Cortez is the author of congressional bill OU812 which would place an upper age-limit on legal voting within the United States to 65. After that age, no citizen would be able to register or even visit a local polling place, and all people currently above that mark would be permanently struck from the rolls immediately. The bill is gaining momentum in the Congress and is likely to pass, and with several Republicans in the Senate already beginning to turn against the conservative movement, it stands a good chance of becoming law. Cortez explained the reasoning behind the bill to a crowd gathered outside of her local nail-art emporium in Blumpkinville, New York:  “So, it’s like, old people – a lot of them get kind of dopey, you know? In their minds? They get Demen-entia. Or that really terrible one, Wisenheimer’s. And then they can’t make decisions very well. That’s why we end up with a professional con man like Trump, right? And then we have to go through all this trouble to impeach him and throw him out and fix their mistake, and it’s not fair. So I figure it could be eliminated altogether if we just stop them from voting stupid. They wont know. We can like, send them little pieces of paper, and they can write ‘Trump’ on them and we can just pat their heads and tell them we’ll put it in the voting car and it’ll drive it to the voting house or whatever. They won’t know the difference. Everyone happy. Okay, I have to go because I heard the new line of Hot Emoticon nail art is out and it’s SOOO delish.”  Experts agree that if the bill passes fairly soon, it will nearly destroy President Trump’s voting base and chances for re-election. But then again, experts also agreed that Killery was going to win in 2016, isn’t that right patriots? And you know, she basically did, but only for the grace of the electoral college, designed exactly for that reason by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Himself. We can only hope and pray that should this bill see the light of day, God will find another way to give America the mentally handicapped President she deserves.  Share this:",false
803bdfbf,UN Forced to Admit Gates-funded Vaccine Is Causing Polio Outbreak in Africa - Global Research,"This really should be one of the biggest public health scandals of the decade, but instead it’s given little attention – mainly because of the high-profile nature of the people and organisations involved. *** The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out. While international organisations like the World Health Organization WHO will regularly boast about ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines—the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa. Health officials have now admitted that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed by a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent wave of polio to spread. This latest pharma-induced pandemic started out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, with the culprit identified as vaccine-derived polio virus type 2. Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world. Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the a pharmaceutical vaccine. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine mOPV2 following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio. The same incident has happened in India as well. It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine is being pushed by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI, a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All of this should be cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giants all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population. Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African populationthrough GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials is taking place in South Africa, run by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—another Gates-funded institution. This latest revelation from Africa should prompt journalists and health advocates to ask harder questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hype COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine. AP News reports… LONDON AP — The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad — a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted across Africa and elsewhere, leaving millions of children vulnerable to infection. In April, WHO and its partners reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to mass polio immunization campaigns, recognizing the move could lead to a resurgence of the disease. In May, they reported that 46 campaigns to vaccinate children against polio had been suspended in 38 countries, mostly in Africa, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the campaigns have recently been re-started, but health workers need to vaccinate more than 90% of children in their efforts to eradicate the paralytic disease. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed. Wild polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan; both countries also are struggling to contain outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio. * Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

adc0db84,Antonio Villaraigosa rips Gavin Newsom over high-speed rail ,"Duration 0:47 Villaraigosa talks high-speed rail in Fresno During a visit to Fresno on Sept. 20, 2017, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa supports California high-speed rail project. By Chrsitopher Cadelago Fresno  Antonio Villaraigosa, stopping off Wednesday in the Central Valley to survey construction of the state’s oft-debated high speed rail system, accused Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom of repeatedly equivocating on the project, criticizing his Democratic rival for governor of being “for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again.”  The former Los Angeles mayor suggested Newsom, the frontrunner in next year’s contest, was revising his positions “when the winds blow in his direction.”  Newsom was an early backer of the rail project, and he campaigned for the $9.95 billion bond measure in 2008. But his opinion soured over route and business plan deviations. Newsom told a Seattle radio program in 2014 that he would use the money for “other, more pressing infrastructure needs.”  Campaigning for governor, he now says he would work to identify more funding, specifically private investment, yet he still worries about the viability of the $64 billion project considered one of the signature infrastructure efforts of Gov. Jerry Brown.  Villaraigosa said Newsom’s shifting rail statements illustrate a broader approach to campaigning. Newsom Recall Watch with Lara Korte  Keep up with Newsom recall news via text, for just $4 a month: Get an inside look at the campaign and what Newsom is doing to fend off challengers.  “When you look at the way he speaks to different audiences and says different things, again and again, I think you have to look at his support with a grain of salt,” he said midway through a tour of rail construction sites in Fresno, accompanied by Dan Richard, the chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Authority.  Newsom’s campaign dismissed the critique, offering that he’s consistently expressed doubts about the project’s ability to attract private dollars, particularly after its route, originally pitched to bond voters as focusing on Los Angeles to San Francisco, was replaced with an initial 32-mile segment under construction between Fresno and Madera counties.  Newsom spokesman Dan Newman said Villaraigosa’s charges are “particularly ludicrous considering the source.”  He ripped Villaraigosa for attending a chamber of commerce political function in Fresno and pointed to his past support for a non-partisan effort, the Campaign to Fix the Debt, which proposed various changes to entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.  “He used to be a Democratic labor organizer, and today he’s literally raising money to support Republicans,” Newman said. “That’s Guinness Book of Records flip floppery.” Capitol Alert newsletter  Get political and Capitol news in your inbox every weekday, plus breaking alerts.

bfd9ddf6,"Langevin, Cicilline Call for Stronger Background Checks","Rhode Island Congressmen Jim Langevin D-RI and David Cicilline D-RI, who both serve on the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, described a Federal Bureau of Investigation report, released by Mayors Against Illegal Guns, as a call to action. The report illustrated Rhode Island’s failure to submit health records of individuals barred from purchasing handguns to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS. Rhode Island ranked among the lowest-performing states in the country, submitting fewer than 100 mental health records since the inception of the database under the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act twenty years ago.  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 requires an individual to pass a background check through the NICS database before purchasing a firearm from a federally licensed dealer, a process that typically takes 90 seconds. Data released last month by the FBI, reflecting record submissions as of May 2013, shows that the NICS remains incomplete, with hundreds of thousands of state and federal records missing. According to the report, the omission of mental health records in the NICS has created dangerous information deficiencies.  “This is an opportunity to educate ourselves on the deficiencies that exist within the NICS and strengthen gun violence prevention efforts in our state. It is critical that we take meaningful action to fill these information gaps and create a more effective background check process,” said Langevin. “I strongly believe that Rhode Island can strengthen its reporting requirements in a manner that respects the balance of privacy and public safety.”  Rhode Island law currently prohibits the disclosure of mental health records without the express permission of the patient or guardian. State lawmakers created a 20-member task force to examine Rhode Island’s participation in the NICS and make recommendations to the General Assembly by January 31.  “As a founding member of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, I strongly believe that commonsense measures, like improving the NICS database, are the best methods to strengthen gun violence prevention in Rhode Island and around the country,” said Cicilline. “Congress needs to work with states to increase measures, like background checks, that protect the public from violence, and I am committed to continue working with the delegation to bring federal resources to improve reporting and bridging the information gaps in these requirements here in our state.”  Earlier this year, Langevin and Cicilline announced the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force’s comprehensive policy principles designed to reduce gun violence while respecting Second Amendment Rights of law-abiding Americans. The Congressmen cosponsored the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act HR 1565, a bipartisan bill that brings all commercial firearm sales under the background check system to prevent criminals and the mentally ill from slipping through loopholes that endanger public safety. Langevin and Cicilline have urged their colleagues in Congress to support this legislation, and other efforts to strengthen funding for mental health and addiction treatment, recognizing the important role these factors play in the conversation on gun violence prevention.",partially false
44c46335,Illegal Alien Crime Accounts for over 30% of Murders in Many States,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump deserves credit for forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration, but it is not “Trump’s issue.” We will be making a fatal mistake if we let the media discuss it that way.  As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the “home of the free and land of the brave.”  But illegal immigration is not “Ann Coulter’s issue” any more than it is “Tom Tancredo’s issue.” It is America’s issue — not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.  Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the “kitchen table debate,” they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.  The media’s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers’ jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.  The mainstream media – including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal — are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.  Let’s look at a few numbers. You haven’t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.  Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%.  During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states.  That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643.  That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.  Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office GAO using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation’s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:  The federal Bureau of Prisons category “criminal aliens” includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.  Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens—averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.  Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don’t ask the question.  There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase “illegal immigrant” to appear in print.  So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don’t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs — the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.  The US Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.  But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?  The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.  This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders.",false
dc063e58,Trump Will Use Emergency Powers To Remove Pelosi From Congress,"A stimulus bill has gone through, but it was a long process due to the depraved obstruction of Nancy Pelosi and the vile Democrats. Their refusal to pass several bills before this showed their indifference to the plight of the American people. Apparently, they just don’t care.  This lack of caring has shocked the nation. Nobody suspected that Pelosi and company would be so callous as to jeopardize American livelihoods during a crisis through partisan politics, yet that’s exactly what happened. People are angry about this, none more so than President Trump himself.  The President is expected to use his powers under the declared State of Emergency to remove Speaker Pelosi from Congress. He will describe her to the court as “a threat to the future safety of the American citizens”, which will allow him to take extraordinary measures to see to her being taken from office. This is an unprecedented move, but a White House insider, who goes by the name of Joe Barron, tells us that Trump feels he has no other choice.  “The President feels that Pelosi’s delay jeopardized the well-being of the people in a time of national emergency. In these times, we must all come together and put our politics aside. The Speaker’s unwillingness to do so makes it clear that she does not have the best interests of the country at heart. It’s felt that her selfishness could cause real harm to the public and to the government’s efforts to eradicate this problem and carry us into the future. He’s getting rid of her.”  At least there is some good coming from this catastrophe. Finally, Pelosi will be gone. We must thank Senator Binks of Naboo for granting these emergency powers to the Supreme Chancellor.",false
df9949a5,Masks Do Not Work. Period.,"Bryan Fischer Radio Host MORE  Mask mania has swept the United States, with some surveys admitting that perhaps 95% of Americans are wearing them, under the entirely illusory belief that the masks are doing them some good.  Unfortunately, no scientific study has demonstrated that masks do any good at all in terms of protecting people from COVID-19. Some mask wearers may feel a little better, because they may feel like they have some protection even though in reality they have none.  Governors and mayors, caught up in the mindless frenzy, are imposing fines on constituents who go au naturale. Houston’s mayor will issue $250 fines after a single warning for those caught without a face covering. Miami issues $100 citations for a first and second offense followed by an arrest on the third offense. Broward County fines violators $1000 a day, and continued malfeasance can put someone behind bars for 60 days.  There might be some slight justification for these draconian measures if masks worked. But they don’t.  The N95 masks, about which there was so much frenzy a couple of months ago, filter stuff that comes in but filter nothing going out since they are designed for contaminated environments. So if you’re in Walmart and somebody comes cruising in wearing an N95 mask, you have no protection at all from him. He may think he’s protecting you, but he’s not. You may think he’s protecting you, but he’s not.  Surgical masks also filter incoming air, but since they are designed for sterile environments they quickly become clogged in normal outdoor environments. Consequently, they must be changed or thrown out every 20-30 minutes in a non-sterile environment. And if you happen to come in contact with pathogens, the particles just become trapped in the mask, and the mask becomes little more than a portable virus dispenser. Every time you take one off and put one on you transfer whatever is on the mask to your face. You are breathing in pathogens from everywhere you’ve been.  The cloth masks, homemade or not, are the worst. Cloth masks do not filter anything, going out or coming in. As you breathe out all you are doing is trapping carbon dioxide in your mask, which is the one thing cloth masks are actually good at. So by wearing one, you are endangering your health more than you are protecting it. The moisture from your breath is caught in these masks and can become mildew ridden overnight. You may wind up with mask-induced dry coughing, allergies, and a sore throat from the micro-mold in your mask.  A review of the scientific literature on COVID-19 reveals that simply put, “masks and respirators do not work. There have been extensive randomized controlled trial RCT studies, and meta-analysis reviews of RCT studies, which all show that masks and respirators do not work to prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, or respiratory illnesses believed to be transmitted by droplets and aerosol particles.”  The reason is that none of the available masks have a mesh that’s fine enough to capture the COVID-19 particles. In fact, the known facts of physics and biology say that masks cannot work. “The main transmission path is long-residence-time aerosol particles < 2.5 μm, which are too fine to be blocked, and the minimum-infective dose is smaller than one aerosol particle.” Emphasis mine. In other words, it only takes a dose smaller than one aerosol particle to infect someone, and none of the masks can capture even a single particle that small.  Here’s a sample of the medical literature on the subject:  Jacobs, J. L. et al. 2009 “Face mask use in HCW Health Care Workers was not demonstrated to provide benefit in terms of cold symptoms or getting colds” which of course are caused by viruses. Plus, the health care workers were significantly more likely to experience headaches.  Cowling, B. et al. 2010 “ None of the studies reviewed showed a benefit from wearing a mask , in either HCW or community members in households therein.  bin-Reza et al. 2012 “There were 17 eligible studies. … None of the studies established a conclusive relationship between mask/respirator use and protection against influenza infection.”  Smith, J.D. et al. 2016 “We identified six clinical studies … . In the meta-analysis of the clinical studies, we found no significant difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks in associated risk of a laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, b influenza-like illness, or c reported work-place absenteeism.”  Offeddu, V. et al. 2017 “Evidence of a protective effect of masks or respirators against verified respiratory infection VRI was not statistically significant .”  Radonovich, L.J. et al. 2019 “Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks as worn by participants in this trial resulted in no significant difference in the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza.”  Long, Y. et al. 2020 “There were no statistically significant differences in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness using N95 respirators and surgical masks.”  Conclusion: “No RCT study with verified outcome shows a benefit for HCW or community members in households to wearing a mask or respirator. There is no such study. There are no exceptions. Likewise, no study exists that shows a benefit from a broad policy to wear masks in public...All of this to say that: if anything gets through and it always does, irrespective of the mask, then you are going to be infected. Masks cannot possibly work. It is not surprising, therefore, that no bias-free study has ever found a benefit from wearing a mask or respirator in this application.”  It’s long past time for our health officials to start dealing in actual science instead of the pseudo-science they’ve been peddling since the beginning of this self-induced, panic-driven hysteria. They should begin today to broadcast loud and clear that there is no known benefit arising from wearing a mask in a viral respiratory illness epidemic.  The bottom line is quite simple: Masks do not work, cannot work, and never will work.  The author may be contacted at bfischer@afa.net",false

f5180639,"AUTOPSY: Chadwick Boseman was POISONED, homicide investigation begins – Toronto Today","Share Messenger Tweet Email Whatsapp reddit  August 29, 2020  Los Angeles, California  Actor Chadwick Boseman died Friday of poisoning, an early autopsy reveals. He was only 43.  Boseman died at his home in the Los Angeles area, his publicist Nicki Fioravante told The Associated Press. Originally, it was thought he had died of cancer. However, during the autopsy, the coroner discovered the actor was actually poisoned, and otherwise healthy.  Chadwick Boseman was poisoned — Kathy Coleman @KJCCOLEMAN August 30, 2020  There is now an active investigation into who administered the poisoning, and are looking into Boseman’s Doctor as a potential suspect. Police are now considering this a homicide, and will be holding a press conference in the next 48 hours.  Boseman was diagnosed with colon cancer four years ago, his family said in a statement. However, the actor was able to beat the disease, which makes his sudden death even more suspicious.  Chadwick Boseman lived his purpose with every role. Each story he helped tell was a service to his community. A true culture worker — Ivie Ani @ivieani August 29, 2020  “A true fighter, Chadwick persevered through it all, and brought you many of the films you have come to love so much,” his family said in the statement. “From ‘Marshall’ to ‘Da 5 Bloods,’ August Wilson’s ‘Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom’ and several more – all were filmed during and between countless surgeries and chemotherapy. It was the honour of his career to bring King T’Challa to life in ‘Black Panther.”’ Unfortunately, it was not the cancer that killed him, it was something else.  Boseman had not spoken publicly about his diagnosis.  Was Chadwick Boseman murdered by Antifa thugs?    Many people are saying he was — Project 1599 @Project_1599 August 29, 2020  Born in South Carolina, Boseman graduated from Howard University and had small roles in television before his first star turn in 2013. His striking portrayal of the stoic baseball star Robinson opposite Harrison Ford in 2013’s “42” drew attention in Hollywood.  Boseman died on a day that Major League Baseball was celebrating Jackie Robinson day.  His T’Challa character was first introduced to the blockbuster Marvel movies in 2016’s “Captain America: Civil War,” and his “Wakanda Forever” salute reverberated around the world after the release of “Black Panther” two years ago.  Chadwick Boseman the actor in black panther was poisoned at the hospital he was being treated at. He represented black strength&power His cancer growth was a BENIGN TUMOR and was told he would return to work before long.

Many of Boseman’s fans have taken to Twitter to make the claim he was poisoned. Ismail Raygal cited the actor’s otherwise good health and plans to return to work.  Some fans have made claims that Boseman was killed by the Illuminati, however, that claim has not been substantiated by any of the sources close to the scene.  RFG ChosenOne – a YouTube Channel with over 78,600 subscribers – has made a claim that Boseman was killed by a “ritual-sacrifice”.

273ab14a,Diabetes warning: More than THIRD of COVID-19 hospital deaths had disease,"Diabetics are more at risk from coronavirus  FREE health tips to live a long and happy life SUBSCRIBE Invalid email Sign up forhealth tips to live a long and happy life When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Experts looked at data on 22,332 confirmed deaths in England since March 31, when pre-existing conditions began to be reported, and found 5,873 were suffering from diabetes. Dementia was the second most common condition linked with COVID mortality, affecting 18 percent of confirmed cases. But just seven percent of patients who died from the respiratory disease had asthma.  The breakdown comes as coronavirus fatalities in the UK rose to 33,614 after 428 more deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours. A total of 233,151 people have now tested positive for the bug across Britain - up 3,446 from yesterday. The death toll refers to those who have died in all settings – including hospitals, care homes, hospices and the community. Around four million Britons are affected by diabetes.  People with the illness have been told they are at higher risk from the pandemic and are being urged to stay indoors as much as possible. Professor Partha Kar, a national speciality advisor for diabetes for the NHS, said: “It is clear that people with diabetes are more at risk of dying from COVID-19 and more detailed analysis is currently underway to understand the link between the two. Initial findings indicate that the threat in people under 40 continues to be very low. “The NHS has put extra measures in place so that people living with diabetes can manage their condition better during the pandemic.  It includes a range of online services, video consultations with your local clinical team and a dedicated helpline for those who need advice.” A separate government survey revealed yesterday that up to 222,000 people in England may be infected with the coronavirus right now. The first round of random tests of 10,000 members of the public has identified only 33 positive cases of COVID-19 and estimated a national infection level of 0.27 percent – one in every 370 people. This suggests that 148,000 people had the virus at any given time between April 27 and May 10, with the official estimate ranging from 94,000 to 222,000. During that time 66,343 people were officially diagnosed.  And the rate of infection is six times higher in healthcare workers and carers than it is in the general population, the survey found. While 1.33 percent of people who worked in patient-facing roles in hospitals or homes tested positive for the virus, only 0.22 percent of those with other jobs did so. The numbers did not include anyone who was tested in a care home or a hospital, where the statisticians said rates of COVID-19 infection are likely to be higher. The 33 people who tested positive came from 30 different households, suggesting they either lived alone or most had managed not to infect the people they lived with.",false
3d932231,Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators,"Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators  -- ADVERTISEMENT --  President Obama is a lightening rod for criticism, as to be expected. This is part of the job that comes along with being POTUS. However, the blatant racism and calls for his death have everything to do with the color of his skin and the hatred in the hearts and minds of some people….but Sheriffs?  Members of the ultra right wing Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association and their leader, Sheriff Richard Mack, went to Washington DC during December for a meeting with some GOP congressional leaders. Mach sat down with Senators Jeff Sessions R-AL and David Vitter R-LA, and Rep. Martha Blackburn R-TN in the Senate building on Dec. 10th.  The details of the meeting were not disclosed, but outside of the building a small protest of right wingers who are not pleased with Obama, his Immigration policy or anything else gathered to voice their displeasure with the world the President is doing.  According to the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Hate Watch, the small gathering of disgruntled sheriffs and officers were chanting.  -- ADVERTISEMENT --  [ADSENSE2]  Here is what they said:  A small group of protesters supporting the sheriffs gathered at the White House and began shouting slogans and demanding the removal of President Obama. Some in the crowd demanded the president be lynched–”Hang the lying Muslim traitor!” one of them shouted.  Sheriff Mack tried to distance himself, the Senators and the Representative after the meeting from the group of protestors with his words, but it became obvious they were all together.  The same group of protesters then proceeded to the Senate building where the sheriffs were meeting, but were not permitted inside and instead lingered in the foyer. When the meeting ended, the demonstrators lustily greeted the emerging law enforcement officers and Congress members, some of them shaking hands and hugging the participants.  You might remember Sheriff Mack from his suggestion of using women as human shields while defending Cliven Bundy, the man who claimed to have sovereign rights to his ranch a few years back. It seems like his delusion and hatred of the President hasn’t waived since.  How Can You Threaten The President?  In this world of cracking down on dangerous rhetoric, how is it possible for someone to stand outside government buildings in DC and threaten the President of the United States?

3c956e4c,Gov. Scott Walker and Mary Burke on public unions,"All Politics Blog From Milwaukee, Madison and beyond, a daily dose of political news and glimpses behind the scenes SHARE  By of the  Madison -- The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is taking a closer look at the positions being taken by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democrat Mary Burke, a former Trek Bicycle executive and state Commerce secretary.  Each week, the newspaper will be putting questions on key issues to Burke and Walker and then publishing their answers on the All Politics Blog, in regular stories and in larger packages that will run closer to the November election.  Here’s the next question and set of answers:  Unions: Would you favor lowering benefit payments or bringing back any bargaining power for public employee unions? Would you favor cutting bargaining for police and firefighters or private-sector workers? Would you favor changing current civil service protections?  Walker: Early in 2010, a teacher in Milwaukee was named the outstanding new English teacher for the entire state. Not long after, she was told she was being laid off. How could this happen? Prior to our Act 10 reforms, most schools had to hire and fire based on seniority and tenure because of union contracts.  Now schools can hire and fire based on merit and pay based on performance. On top of that, schools saved tens of millions of dollars by bidding out health insurance while state and local governments were able to clamp down on overtime abuses to save real money.  In contrast, as a member of the Madison School Board, Mary Burke voted to keep the pre-Act 10 contracts and her first budget vote included a sizable property tax increase. So far, she refuses to answer a simple question: Would she sign a bill to repeal Act 10? I support our Act 10 reforms because they saved the taxpayers some $3 billion.  Burke: I support the right of public employees to collectively bargain and will work to restore that right. This does not stand in the way of having accountable, effective and efficient government. Concessions on health care and pension contributions could have been achieved through collective bargaining. I know from my business experience that ensuring workers feel respected and have a voice is a big part of attracting and retaining a qualified work force.  The following elements of Act 10 were politically-motivated attempts to punish unions and I would work to repeal them – 1 Annual recertification elections requiring approval of 51% of membership, 2 Prohibiting “fair share” arrangements, 3 Prohibiting automatic dues deductions.  I see no reason to curtail bargaining for police, firefighters or private-sector workers. An aging public work force presents challenges for efficient, accountable government. I am open to updating our civil service protections and policies to address these challenges.",partially false
1e701449,Pelosi Wants To Remove Votes From Soldiers Overseas: ‘They Don’t Even Live Here’,"It has long been established that Democrats cheat in order to win elections. They have undocumented citizens cast votes for them, they have dead people vote for them, have people of color vote for them, and the list goes on and on.  No, they have sunk to a new low. Nancy Pelosi and her cronies seek to disrespect our troops even more than they have thus far through defunding and constant criticism of heroic acts. Pelosi announced today that she intends to bring forth a new bill that would disqualify members of the military who serve overseas from voting in the coming presidential election.  Most people automatically assumed that this was being proposed in response to Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting. A tit-for-tat situation. Pelosi knows that 95 percent of military personnel support Trump and saw an opportunity to eliminate those votes. The truth is actually much more sinister.  The announcement was met with snark and outrage from her Republican counterparts who called Pelosi an unAmerican fascist communist totalitarian Russian trader. The Speaker of the House was quick to respond:  “Voting is a privilege for Americans who will be affected by the decisions of the elected. Republicans have pointed this out to us many times. So I’m just playing along. Some of these young men and women have been out of country for years. Why should they get to vote? They don’t even live here. We need to strengthen our elections, not weaken them by allowing foreigners to participate. That’s essentially what these soldiers have become- foreigners. They’ve given up on being American by working for so long out of country. American elections are for Americans. There is some point to be made here, but I’ll figure that out later.”  Nancy Pelosi appears to be becoming quite senile in her old age. That loss of her wits has made her forget who our American military is and what do you do for us. They are, perhaps, the most American of us all.",false
26898e5b,"Inauguration Cancelled, Trump Remains in Office, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, CNN, MSNBC to Loose Licenses","Joe Biden’s Inauguration has been cancelled, President Trump would remain in office and the Chinese Communist Party propaganda media outlets of ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC would soon be off the airwaves according to President Trump.  “I have invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 Section 10 U.S. Code 13 251-255 to address the treasonous rebellion conducted by Democrat and Republican lawmakers, CCP Agents Chinese Communist Party, FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others to dismantle the United States of America and it’s Constitution,” President Trump declared on Thursday 14 Jan. “These entities pose a direct threat to national security. I will remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies are arrested.”  President Trump invoked the Insurrection Act after another assassination attempt on him last Sat. morning 9 Jan. According to his Intel, Chinese Communist Party Agents, the FBI, Department of Justice, CIA and others of the Deep State have – with the help of the Main Stream Media – long been planning to dismantle the US and it’s Constitution.  Of course, none of these treasonous acts have been reported by the corrupt Main Stream Media. Trump had evidence that the MSM was “embedded with CIA and Chinese Communist Party agents whose sole purpose was to direct public opinion toward a Deep State agenda.”  During President Trump’s four years in office he and what has been referred to as the Alliance have been fighting this Cabal – a Satan worshipping force composed of thirteen Satanist Bloodline families out of Italy, the Vatican, UK Monarchy, British M16, Chinese Communist Party, CIA, FBI, Department of Justice, Antifa, Black Lives Matter and certain Republican and Democratic Lawmakers. Another attempt on his life was the last straw.  Since that Sat. 9 Jan. the US has been under an abbreviated Martial Law with President Trump as Commander in Chief and General Flynn in charge of the Military. As such Trump has signed multiple Executive Orders that among other powers, allowed for Military arrests and Tribunals.  Soon to be acted upon were well over 222,286 sealed indictments against political and global elites filed in federal courts across the nation.  https://operationdisclosure.blogspot.com/2021/01/sealed-indictments-as-of-december-31.html#more  By law with the Insurrection Act in effect, Trump would remain President indefinitely until all domestic enemies were arrested. He would soon take down the Main Stream Media.  “I’m drafting an Executive Order to take the following propaganda media outlets off the airwaves: ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. I am also working with the FCC to pull their licenses. We have evidence that all of these media organizations employ agents of the Chinese Communist Party as well as embedded CIA Agents whose sole purpose is to brainwash, hypnotize and direct public opinion toward certain agendas that support the Left and Deep State. These organizations are a threat to national security and virtually nothing they report is actual news.”  It’s no small task to take down the Cabal. Military and Special Forces units have been deploying all over the US in 400+ cities. Right now there were over 15,000 troops in DC according to Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy. Special Forces units have covertly infiltrated Antifa and Black Lives Matter and made silent covert arrests.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4_DNABtptU  That same Sat. 9 Jan. POTUS and the Department of Defense postponed the 20 Jan. Presidential Inauguration. Intel sources claimed that if Joe Biden was not inaugurated there were corrupt-FBI plans to help stage Antifa and BLM violence in DC and at the 50 state capitols from Sat 16 Jan. through Wed. 20 Jan. Biden couldn’t be inaugurated anyway because of the Insurrection Act that demanded Trump remain in office “until all domestic enemies were arrested.”  A corrupt Mass Media has refused to report anything but their Left Wing agenda believed paid for by the CCP. Thus, the President has announced he would soon activate the Emergency Broadcast System EBS. This was expected during what has been referred to as Ten Days of Darkness, or media outage.  With the EBS everyone would get alerts on their phones, TV, radio and Internet that would override other broadcasts for several hours at a time. The broadcasts would explain the silent war happening across the globe between the Cabal and Alliance.  This week Trump Intel providers Robert David Steele and Juan OSavin explained, “This may not be settled until April 1. Anyone including Fox, who refuses to broadcast the President of the US faces loss of their FCC licenses as well as criminal punitive actions, perhaps a military takeover.”  On Wed. 13 Jan. in an urgent message to the American people President Trump called for peace. Intel sources were reporting that riots were planned in DC and across the nation. He condemned the rioters at the state capitol, as well as a recent assault by Social Media on our Freedom of Speech and then activated military forces to quell unrest.  https://trendingpolitics.com/breaking-president-trump-releases-urgent-video-message-to-the-american-people/  The recent violation of Social Media platforms to censor Freedom of Speech was of concern. Donald Trump Jr. to the rescue. Trump Jr. announced that a new social media platform was coming soon called the Freedom Social Network.  More important, President Trump had officially shut down the Cabal’s USA Inc. and re-started a restored Republic on 4 July 2020.  https://web.archive.org/web/20110720183531/http://reality-bytes.hubpages.com/hub/The-Corporation-Of-The-United-States-Of-America  It was all a part of the Alliance’s Plan to free the globe of the Communist Parties /Cabal’s suppression of The People. “The Plan To Save The World”:  https://rumble.com/vagd07-q-the-plan-to-save-the-world-remastered.html  https://www.bitchute.com/video/qvfUkQTG5QHP/  As part of that plan President Trump’s Space Force has been involved in worldwide blackouts in multiple countries as Alliance Special Force units made arrests. Overnight to Sun. 10 Jan. multiple arrests were conducted, including in Frankfurt Germany – home of the CIA office where Dominion Voting machines illegally changed Trump votes to Biden in the 2020 Election.  Over last weekend French and Russia Alliance military leaders’ Special Force units took out Deep Staters in Italy, Pakistan, Berlin and Paris. By the first of the week they had moved to Iran where they caused Blackouts in order to target global and regional terrorism.  By Tues. 12 Jan. the White House had launched the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office. This officially activated Space Force and it’s Quantum Computer that would put us and the world on the Gold Standard, provide a transparent and instantaneous Quantum Voting System for our first Restored Republic Election in March 2021, plus provided the platform for a top secret Global Broadcast Satellite Program that could override all TV screens for President Trump’s worldwide addresses.  During this coming weekend to 20 Jan. there may be food and supply shortages, on-off outages of communication, media and social media, plus ATM and credit card transaction disruptions. You were advised to be prepared.  The Alliance was composed of President Trump, Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi, White Hats in the Department of Defense headed by Secretary of Defense Chris Miller, Undersecretary of Defense Intel Ezra Cohen Watnick and Gen.

96eaa6b9,Smoking Gun! Joe Biden’s Dept. of Energy Blocked Texas from Increasing Power Ahead of Killer Storm,"An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.  Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power!   Going into effect Sunday, Feb. 14, Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.  The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.”  ",false
0a92fcec,"Tom Hanks, 65, Passes Away, Confessed Admiration for Trump at the End","Prolific acting legend, Tom Hanks, passed away suddenly this morning. The cause of his death has not been released.  Hanks enjoyed a long and successful career. He was well-liked by all those in the Hollywood community and his movies were always well received by the public, even the really crappy ones like “Castaway.” His body of work will live on for decades to come.  For the past several years, Hanks had been been very vocal with his opposition to President Trump. He often called the president names, none of which can be printed here, and when he did so, he made sure that his comments were broadcast far and wide for the public to hear. His deep hatred for President Trump has been very well known.  Of course, we all know why he said those things about Trump. Hanks was known to be a frequent visitor to Epstein Island and so he knew that the president was coming for him. His using all that energy on discrediting Trump’s every move was clearly an attempt to have him removed from office which would then allow him to stay free from prison.  While on his deathbed , however, Hanks must have realized that there was no point in carrying on the ruse any longer. According to his wife, Tom made a deathbed confession, the likes of which no one would have ever expected.  In it, he confessed his love for President Trump and all his accomplishments to date. He went so far as to say that the president was “really really great“ and that Trump “was the best possible choice for America. He’s done stellar work so far.”  His wife, Rita, was impressed by his honesty at the end but said that she wished he had told her all that years ago so that she could have “dumped his trumpy ass.”  The world has lost an iconic acting legend, but that’s not all. This revelation from Tom shows that we have also lost a future vote for Trump.  Share this:  .  .",false

27838a55,Stand and Fight,"By Wayne LaPierre  Before I tell you how the NRA and our members are going to Stand And Fight politically and in the courts, let’s acknowledge that all over this country, tens of millions of Americans are already preparing to Stand And Fight to protect their families and homes.  These good Americans are prudently getting ready to protect themselves.  It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people.  During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing. Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States. Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S./Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last.  The president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border. So the border today remains porous not only to people seeking jobs in the U.S., but to criminals whose jobs are murder, rape, robbery and kidnapping. Ominously, the border also remains open to agents of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations. Numerous intelligence sources have confirmed that foreign terrorists have identified the southern U.S. border as their path of entry into the country.  When the next terrorist attack comes, the Obama administration won’t accept responsibility. Instead, it will do what it does every time: blame a scapegoat and count on Obama’s “mainstream” media enablers to go along.  A heinous act of mass murder—either by terrorists or by some psychotic who should have been locked up long ago—will be the pretext to unleash a tsunami of gun control.  No wonder Americans are buying guns in record numbers right now, while they still can and before their choice about which firearm is right for their family is taken away forever.  After Hurricane Sandy, we saw the hellish world that the gun prohibitionists see as their utopia. Looters ran wild in south Brooklyn. There was no food, water or electricity. And if you wanted to walk several miles to get supplies, you better get back before dark, or you might not get home at all.  Anti-gun New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg had already done everything he could to prevent law-abiding New Yorkers from owning guns, and he has made sure that no ordinary citizen will ever be allowed to carry a gun. He even refused to allow the National Guard into the city to restore civil order because Guardsmen carry guns!  Meanwhile, President Obama is leading this country to financial ruin, borrowing over a trillion dollars a year for phony “stimulus” spending and other payoffs for his political cronies. Nobody knows if or when the fiscal collapse will come, but if the country is broke, there likely won’t be enough money to pay for police protection. And the American people know it.  Hurricanes. Tornadoes. Riots. Terrorists. Gangs. Lone criminals. These are perils we are sure to face—not just maybe. It’s not paranoia to buy a gun. It’s survival. It’s responsible behavior, and it’s time we encourage law-abiding Americans to do just that.  Since the election, millions of Americans have been lining up in front of gun stores, Cabela’s and Bass Pro Shops exercising their freedom while they still have it. They are demonstrating they have a mass determination to buy, own and use firearms. Millions of Americans are using market forces like never before to demonstrate their ardent support for our firearm freedoms. That’s one of the very best ways we can Stand And Fight.  Inevitably, the anti-gun media and the gun-ban lobbies are demonizing the purchase of firearms. They call us “extremists” because we wonder whether we will be able to buy a semi-auto in three years or, even in some states, later this year. That’s despite the fact that President Obama long ago made clear that he wants to ban them all!  The media try to make rank-and-file Americans feel guilty about buying a gun. The enemies of freedom demonize gun buyers and portray us as social lepers. But we know the truth. We know that responsible gun ownership exemplifies what is good and right about America.  Responsible Americans realize that the world as we know it has changed. We, the American people, clearly see the daunting forces we will undoubtedly face: terrorists, crime, drug gangs, the possibility of Euro-style debt riots, civil unrest or natural disaster.  Gun owners are not buying firearms because they anticipate a confrontation with the government. Rather, we anticipate confrontations where the government isn’t there—or simply doesn’t show up in time.  To preserve the inalienable, individual human right to keep and bear arms—to withstand the siege that is coming—the NRA is building a four-year communications and resistance movement. The enemies of the Second Amendment will be met with unprecedented defiance, commitment and determination. We will Stand And Fight.  First, we are going to devise legal capability like never before. I fervently hope that President Obama does not get to appoint another anti-gun Supreme Court justice like Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. But he probably will, and we must meet that challenge. His chances of appointing a replacement for one of the five pro-rights justices in the 5-4 Heller and McDonald majorities are high. And there’s no doubt he is going to appoint a huge number of new judges to lifetime positions in the lower federal courts.  That means the federal courts are going to get worse and worse. So some cases, on which we might have improved our chances of victory by waiting a while, are going to have to be brought now.  Besides bringing affirmative pro-rights cases, we will also have to litigate against the flood of new anti-gun federal regulations that are coming, and against anti-gun laws that are going to be enacted in some of the states.  Second, we must strengthen the NRA like never before. We are, and always have been, a genuine grassroots organization. And never has your membership been more important. Never has the nra been more in need of your support.  The national media, with its slanted and inaccurate “news” coverage of the gun issue, has given the gun-ban groups the equivalent of hundreds of millions of dollars of free advertising.  Now, the threat is even greater. Michael Bloomberg and George Soros are each, individually, far wealthier than the entire National Rifle Association. When the NRA spends money on political advertising, we have to raise those funds from you—$20, $50, $250, or $1,000 at a time. In the last election, Bloomberg alone spent $16 million and that doesn’t even count the indirect spending by groups funded by Soros and his fellow billionaires.  The hard truth is that due to Bloomberg, Soros, and the rest of their ilk, the dangers require that we increase our presence all across the country—in Congress, the state capitols, and in your city and towns.  As we Stand And Fight, the third, and most important, part of our action plan demands that we organize like never before. That’s the most important part of all.  Every gun owner should be an active member of the NRA. Every gun owner should be sure that every member of his or her family is an active member.  For most of the last hundred years, a strong NRA has been the indispensable shield against the destruction of our nation’s Second Amendment rights. Now, an even stronger nra is the only chance gun owners have to withstand the coming siege.  This begins with remembering to keep your own membership active, or reactivate it if it has lapsed. It means reminding yourself, “I have a son and daughter who aren’t members and should be.” It means reaching out to your hunting and shooting friends and personally telling them why it’s so important that they join the NRA now, during this time of peril.  The NRA is launching a nationwide, full-court initiative to urge every gun owner, and every non-gun-owning lover of freedom, to join the NRA and fight this battle. I will personally be traveling all over America enlisting new members.  We must reach out to the tens of millions of gun owners who are not yet NRA members—to the gun owners who care about their own rights but who have been duped by Obama and the national media into believing that the Obama and Bloomberg gun controls will only affect other people. They are naively sitting on the sidelines, imagining themselves immune from the coming siege.  Yet no matter how much I travel, I can’t be everywhere. NRA members, though, can be everywhere. We already are. The 4 million of us belong to every community in the United States. We are the largest civil rights organization in the world, and we have been part of the fabric of America ever since 1871. So it is you, proud NRA members, who are the key to enlisting new members in the ranks of our army of freedom.  NRA grassroots has always been our Association’s greatest strength. To compete with Bloomberg and his gang, it must be much stronger still. Historically, we have always been able to rely on volunteers, and I’m going to ask you and need you to answer the call to help throughout the next four years.  Every year, shooting is becoming more and more popular, with more people engaging in the shooting sports for fun. More people are buying guns and trying new disciplines, such as 3-gun competitions, sporting clays, practical shooting and so on.  As we Stand And Fight, let’s continue to make the shooting sports one of the fastest-growing recreational activities in America. By doing so, and by telling others about it, we’ll popularize and make gun owning and shooting more mainstream than ever before. That will be even more effective if we remember to invite new people to participate and provide them with the responsible mentorship and guidance that the NRA has exemplified for over 140 years.  We can’t win the political war if we lose the cultural war. One of the great protectors of the Second Amendment is the popular, active, responsible use of firearms for shooting and hunting.  We don’t want America to become like England, where some of that nation’s outstanding rifle competitors keep their hobby a dark secret from their neighbors for fear of social disapproval. We’re not going to let the anti-gunners push us into that zone. As I remind people every day, we are the majority.  We have so much to be proud of as gun owners, shooters and freedom lovers. That pride, especially when it’s not hidden in the closet, is itself a form of protection for the Second Amendment.  We will not surrender. We will not appease. We will buy more guns than ever. We will use them for sport and lawful self-defense more than ever. We will grow the NRA more than ever. And we will be prouder than ever to be freedom-loving NRA patriots. And with your help, we will ensure that the Second Amendment remains America’s First Freedom.  We will Stand And Fight.",partially false
8817ebf3,Antifa gearing up for false flag violence disguised as Trump-supporters,"With merchants in Democrat-run cities boarding up their storefront windows, the possibility of serious urban violence is well understood. As horrific as that could get ask anyone who lives in Minneapolis, the progressive fascists appear to have a plan in place to make it even worse: disguising their rioters as Trump-supporters in order to make the case that Donald Trump truly is a dictator that must be violently overthrown if he wins or arrested and prosecuted if he loses. A source that has always been reliable was able to photograph an Antifa flyer: What makes all of this particularly chilling is that progressives already are absurdly claiming that the threat of violence comes from our side. Portland's Mayor Ted Wheeler warns of white racist rioters inspired by the rhetoric from Washington, D.C. i.e., Trump: Given the heightened concerns about potential violence, particularly from white supremist organizations and the divisive rhetoric from Washington, D.C., the need for coordination and partnership takes on statewide significance. Oregon is likely to be a flashpoint. — Mayor Ted Wheeler @tedwheeler November 2, 2020 Other media players, such Vox and the New York Times, warn of both sides, a disguise of balance but ridiculously unrealistic, considering the utter lack of property destruction by the right and massive destruction at the hands of the left since Gorge Floyd's death in police custody. Tucker Carlson and Lisa Boothe last night addressed Ted Wheeler's warning and correctly pointed out its absurdity. As they noted, if merchants believed that white supremacists were the threat, they would not be spray-painting We support Black Lives Matter on their plywood window coverings. If they thought Ted Wheeler were for real, not a vicious liar, they would spray white power rhetoric. The segment begins at about 1:30 in the video below courtesy of Media Matters!: Dan Crenshaw makes a similar point: Trump’s chaos? Last I checked, businesses weren’t boarding up their windows because they were afraid of Trump supporters. https://t.co/XALmvJ0H2t — Dan Crenshaw @DanCrenshawTX November 1, 2020 Speaking of Tucker C., his opening monologue last night nailed it, explaining what this election is all about.

6130328a,Flu Vaccine Deaths in South Korea risen to nearly 100; Prime Minister asks for Investigation,"After the Korean Medical Association had called on Seoul to stop the flu vaccination program for a review, South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun finally called for an investigation for the safety issues. This is because the death toll in South Korea after getting flu vaccines has rose to 97; as reported by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency KDCA last week. The KDCA, however, still denies that there is a connection between these seemingly genocidal phenomena and the vaccines being used in the government’s free flu shot program. What’s more disturbing is that the KCDA still urges the SK citizens to continue getting vaccination despite the growing number of dead flu vaccine recipients. To some, this is not surprising for an institution like the KCDA. Such organizations claiming to be in charge of diseases control and prevention, while ironically tainted with conflicts of interest, have been proven to be untrustworthy and deceiving when it comes to science many times in history. For example, a report from Children’s Health Defence CHD website stated the following: “The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC recommends that everyone aged six months and up, including pregnant women, get an annual flu shot to protect against the influenza virus. The mainstream media characterize this recommendation as being firmly grounded in science. The demonstrable truth of the matter, however, is that what the government and media say science says and what science actually tells us are two completely different things.” What’s more diabolical is that they even recommend this flu vaccine to pregnant women! On the same report, the CHD website also wrote: “The CDC’s recommendation that pregnant women get the flu shot is all the more disturbing given the fact that multi-dose vials of the flu vaccine contain the preservative Thimerosal, which is half ethylmercury by weight. Ethylmercury is a known neurotoxin that can cross the blood-brain barrier and accumulate in the brain. It can also cross the placental barrier and enter the brain of the developing fetus.” Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the flu vaccine being used to the SK citizens has contributed or probably the main cause of death. Even if the manufacturers and the state health departments often deny it, common sense would tell us that substances containing heavy metals such as mercury and aluminium, not to mention dozens of other questionable and alarming agents in the vaccine, are very detrimental and should not be put in a human’s body. For instance, during the last year’s United Nation UN summit regarding vaccination, doctors and other experts admitted that there has been no proof that vaccines are safe and effective. In a report published in the naturalnews.com, Dr. Stephen Evans, a Professor of Pharmacoepidemiology stated in the video: “It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention. It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity vaccine adverse reactions and side effects in many instances, and therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen…” Despite the claims by the proponents of vaccines, a peer-reviewed study reveals that unvaccinated people are most protected against influenza flu. In one of its numerous reports about flu vaccines, globalresearch.ca wrote: “At least six separate studies conducted by the same people that are still pushing the flu shot have confirmed that seasonal flu shots make people more prone to contracting the flu. The evidence is now overwhelming that, rather than impart immunity as long claimed, flu shots actually destroy the immune system and increase the risk of infection.” References: Featured image: https://www.fiercepharma.com/vaccines/deaths-rattle-south-korea-s-seasonal-flu-vaccination-but-authority-presses-ahead-free",partially false
350ee2a0,"EXCLUSIVE: Black Lives Matter Website, ‘Defund The Police’ Donations Go Through ‘Act Blue’: Biden’s Top Source of Donations","The National Pulse can reveal the Black Lives Matter website – the organization spearheading nationwide “defund the police” campaigns – is partnered with ActBlue, a Democrat fundraising platform that is the top donor to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, responsible for raising nearly 99.64 percent of the Biden for President effort.  While the Biden campaign insists it doesn’t support efforts to defund the police, it may happily profit from Black Lives Matter BLM efforts, and is complicit in taking money from an organization partnered with those spearheading the dangerous policy that has already taken root in Minneapolis, New York, and Los Angeles.  After reaching the BLM homepage, which features a “Defund The Police” petition front and center, if a user chooses to donate, they’re rerouted to a site hosted by ActBlue and prompted with the message: “We appreciate your support of the movement and our ongoing fight to end state-sanctioned violence, liberate Black people, and end white supremacy forever.”  The page notes: “By proceeding with this transaction, you agree to ActBlue’s terms & conditions”and includes a banner “ActBlue Charities is a qualified 501c3 tax-exempt organization and donations are tax-deductible to the full extent allowed under the law” at the bottom of the page.  Joe Biden is a top beneficiary of the ActBlue’s fundraising efforts.  As of May 21st, the organization has donated $119,253,857 to the “Biden for President” effort.  And Biden for President, the campaign’s official committee, is the main source of revenue for the former veep’s presidential efforts, surpassing all other fundraising organizations by over $100 million.  ActBlue contributions comprise 99.64 percent of all funds raised for the “Biden for President” entity and the total is nearly 773 times greater than the group with the second-highest donation sum.  If Biden doesn’t support defunding the police – an increasingly prevalent call among far-left activists and politicians – then his campaign’s financial lifeline shouldn’t be at the forefront of funding the movement.",false
ca8931d3,Delingpole: Arch-Brexiteer Rod Liddle Surrenders to Remain,"“No Deal” Brexit is the only Brexit worth having – because it’s the only Brexit for which people actually voted.  How stupid do you have to be not to realise this?  Sure, for months and months we’ve been deluged with Remainer propaganda in the largely pro-Remain media claiming there’ll be chaos and economic disaster if Britain “crashes out” of the European Union on World Trade Organisation WTO terms.  But most of us know that this is just Project Fear 2.0 spin designed to obscure the fact the most of the world trades with the EU on WTO terms. Do Singapore, India, Hong Kong and the U.S. really look like they are suffering as a result?  So what on earth provoked one of the UK media’s staunchest Brexiteers Rod Liddle to write this abject surrender monkey drivel in today’s Sun?  Sure, I’m no fan of Theresa’s Pedigree Chum plan — a dog’s dinner if ever there was one. Truth be told, I’d rather we crashed out with no deal at all. But that would be more dangerous — for the British economy and even for Brexit. And waiting in the wings if the Prime Minister fails to get her plan through is Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party. Frankly, I would rather stay in the EU than have Jezza as Prime Minister. As Tom Harris, a Labour Brexiteer, put it, May’s deal gives us Leavers slightly more than half of what we voted for. And given the result of the referendum two years ago, that seems about right to me. None of us get exactly what we want. But we do leave the EU and we retain control of our borders. And soon we’ll be free to strike our own, independent, trade deals. Reach out to the rest of the world. That seems to me a decent compromise. The problem lies in convincing the arch-Brexiteer Conservative MPs that now is the time to give up the fight. I understand their many reservations. But the reality is the deal May puts before the House of Commons is about the only solution that stands a chance of winning a majority. And we are in this position largely because the Tory Brexiteers never managed to sort themselves out. At every stage, they were divided among themselves and too often concerned about their political careers. So if this isn’t the deal we all wanted, they have themselves to blame.  This is so wrong, so disingenuous, so factually inaccurate from Britain’s best-paid journalist whose stock in trade is – usually – his fearless honesty.  Among the many appalled Twitter comments my favourite comes from Mark Millar:  I actually had to reread that to process it properly. It reads like one of those statements captured pilots give to camera while an interrogator holds a machine-gun off-camera. — Mark Millar @mrmarkmillar January 3, 2019  I wonder who in Theresa May’s dark arts department has persuaded Rod of the virtues of this betrayal of the Brexit cause. It doesn’t augur well, does it? If they can get to Rod, then no one is safe.  Oh, and by the way, did I ever mention how wonderful Theresa May’s “Deal” is and how ingeniously it delivers on the Brexit vote while making sure that disruption will be kept to a minimum and that all the Remainers will be happy because nothing will actually change, which is all anyone really wanted? We should support this brave, principled woman.  Yours, Lord Delingpole",false
d8bc460f,BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: System ‘Glitch’ Also Uncovered In Wisconsin – Reversal of Swapped Votes Removes Lead from Joe Biden,"We’ve reported on numerous events identified in the 2020 election already which are being referred to as ‘glitches’ by the Democrats. Tonight we just uncovered another ‘glitch’ in Wisconsin.  When this one is confirmed it will result in a 19,500 vote gain for Trump making the Wisconsin race a total toss-up.  There is now a pattern of events we have uncovered across the country where votes are being taken from Republicans at all levels and transferred to competing Democrats in offsetting amounts. These are not random because in every case votes are moved from Republicans to Democrats.  This is beginning to appear like a strategy used by the Democrats to steal this election.    TRENDING: HUGE EXCLUSIVE: Michigan AG Dana Nessel Sends Cease and Desist Order to Journalist Demanding He Erase His #DetroitLeaks Video Showing Voter Fraud Training -- OR FACE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION  We reported first on a system glitch, as it was labeled, in Michigan which switched 6,000 votes back to President Trump.  Then another example was uncovered in Oakland County Michigan where again a Republican won his race as a result this glitch being reversed.  Then in Pennsylvania a ‘glitch’ was uncovered where nearly 20,000 votes were moved from President Trump to Biden.  When this is confirmed it will result Biden’s lead being cut by 40,000 votes in Pennsylvania bringing this race back to even:  Then we found approximately 6,000 votes which were taken from Trump and moved to Biden in Georgia due to a ‘glitch’:  Now tonight we have identified approximately 10,000 votes that were moved from President Trump to Biden in just one Wisconsin County.  This information came from an individual who saw this happen in Rock County Wisconsin.  On election night the results of the county were presented during the evening and showed that President Trump won Wisconsin in 2016. At 10:59 the votes came in and the race was close with both candidates at around 29,000 ballots. Then by 11:12 President Trump had taken a nearly 1,000 vote lead on Biden with 31,000 votes to Biden’s 30,000:  In  At 11:21 these results had not changed much. Then at 11:43 more votes came in and they showed Trump had taken a commanding lead at 46,649 to Biden’s 37,133. This was a 9,516 vote lead for Trump.  But then suddenly at 11:57 these votes had swapped. Biden was reported with 46,649 and Trump was reduced to Biden’s former total of 37,133. These votes had swapped from the President Trump to Biden – again a swap from a Republican to a Democrat.  The net impact was 19,032 votes.  We checked these numbers again tonight from a different source and the final numbers are still showing Biden ahead of President Trump by the same 9,516 votes.  Currently the race in Wisconsin is showing Biden with a lead of 1,630,570 votes to President Trump’s 1,610,030 votes. When this adjustment is confirmed Biden will only hold a 1,508 vote lead.  This of course is before any of the hundreds of thousands of questionable votes showing up for Biden in Milwaukee early in the morning after the election are validated.  Maybe it is time to classify these ‘glitches’ that go only one way – in the Democrats favor – as a Strategy to steal the election, not a ‘glitch’.  This is now a countrywide issue.

ea538d9a,The Fight for Wisconsin’s Soul - The New York Times,"Equally troubling was the more recent discovery by Tom Fitz, a geology professor at Northland College in Ashland, Wis., of a highly carcinogenic asbestos-form mineral at one of GTac’s sampling sites. The fibers of the mineral, which would be dispersed in blasting, are like tiny, breathable needles.  Last September, several hundred people gathered outside John F. Kennedy Memorial Airport in Ashland, a few miles from GTac’s mining site, to commemorate Kennedy’s 1963 speech, which called for legislation to protect the area’s natural resources and promoted its economic potential as a scenic region for recreation. One of the last to speak at the event was Mike Wiggins Jr., the chairman of the Bad River tribe and the mine’s most formidable opponent.  The Bad River fear the contamination of the fish they depend on for food and the destruction of sensitive wild rice beds that they harvest on the coast of Lake Superior. Mr. Wiggins has voiced his opposition to the mining legislation in private meetings with Mr. Walker, led Wisconsin’s tribes in demonstrations at the State Capitol in Madison and allocated hundreds of thousands of dollars of the Bad River tribe’s scant resources to legal fees to fight the mine.  The Bad River and several other tribes assert that the state has no right to permit the enormous mine without their agreement since the site lies in “ceded territory,” an area covering a large portion of Northern Wisconsin where tribal members maintain special hunting, fishing and harvesting rights enshrined in federal treaties. Last June, one of the tribes established an educational camp near the mining site to draw attention to how the mine would violate its treaty rights, as well as to highlight sustainable alternatives to mining. GTac responded to a minor altercation with protesters unconnected to the camp by hiring an Arizona-based private-security firm, which sent guards armed with semiautomatic weapons to patrol the mine site. The guards have since been withdrawn; the camp is still there.  In the Chippewa tradition, a decision is made based on how it will affect people seven generations forward. By contrast, the company’s optimistic estimate for the life span of the first phase of the mine is 35 years. Last summer Mr. Wiggins played Governor Walker a recording of Kennedy’s speech. Mr. Wiggins said that the governor appeared indifferent to Kennedy’s words; Mr. Walker has never wavered in his support of the mine.  Though GTac has already begun bulk sampling iron ore at the site, the mine still faces many hurdles before it can be permitted. The company has filed incomplete sampling applications with the state’s Department of Natural Resources. GTac’s president, Bill Williams, is facing a criminal inquiry in Spain for alleged environmental crimes, which are unrelated to the GTac mine. The charges state that runoff from an open-pit mine where he once worked as an executive contaminated local groundwater. Mr. Williams denies the charges and declined to comment on them. Most important, the tribes will almost certainly challenge the mine in federal court.  Mr. Wiggins and five other tribal leaders have already begun seeking redress from the federal government. Last August, they sent President Obama a letter asking him to direct the Interior Department to prevent the construction of GTac’s mine, citing their claims that the mine would infringe on their treaty rights.  Though the letter did not mention it, five years ago Mr. Obama told nearly 400 Native American tribal leaders, “We have a lot to learn from your nations in order to create the kind of sustainability in our environment that we so desperately need.” The president said that the tribes “deserve to have a voice” and “will not be forgotten as long as I’m in this White House.” Last week, Mr. Wiggins said that although he has gotten preliminary responses from two federal agencies, he is still awaiting an answer from the president.",partially false
28afa379,The 1% blunder: How a simple but fatal math mistake by US Covid-19 experts caused the world to panic and order lockdowns,"By Malcolm Kendrick , doctor and author who works as a GP in the National Health Service in England. His blog can be read here and his book, 'Doctoring Data – How to Sort Out Medical Advice from Medical Nonsense,' is available here .  In February, US Covid guru Anthony Fauci predicted the virus was ‘akin to a severe flu’ and would therefore kill around 0.1 percent of people. Then fatality rate predictions were somehow mixed up to make it look ten times WORSE.  When you strip everything else out, the reason for lockdown comes from a single figure: one percent. This was the prediction that Covid, if left unchecked, would kill around one percent of us.  You may not think that percentage is enormous, but one percent of the population of the world is 70 million people – and that’s a lot. It would mean 3.2 million Americans dead, and 670,000 Britons.  But where did this one percent figure come from? You may find this hard to believe, but this figure emerged by mistake. A pretty major thing to make a mistake about, but that’s what happened.  Also on rt.com Up to 90% who test positive for Covid barely carry any virus & aren't contagious, making it hard to grasp true scale of virus  Such things occur. On September 23, 1998, NASA permanently lost contact with the Mars Climate Orbiter. It was supposed to go round and round the planet looking at the weather, but instead it hit Mars at around 5,000 mph, exploding into tiny fragments. It didn’t measure the weather; it became the weather – for a few seconds anyway.  An investigation later found that the disaster happened because engineers had used the wrong units. They didn’t convert pound seconds into Newton seconds when doing their calculations. Imperial, not metric. This, remember, was NASA. An organisation not completely full of numbskulls.  Now you and I probably have no idea of the difference between a pound second and a Newton second it’s 0.67 – I looked it up. But you would kind-of hope NASA would. In fact, I am sure they do, but they didn’t notice, so the figures came out wrong. The initial mistake was made, and was baked into the figures.  Kaboom!  With Covid, a similar mistake happened. One type of fatality rate was substituted for another. The wrong rate was then used to predict the likely death rate – and, as with NASA, no-one picked up the error.  In order to understand what happened, you have to understand the difference between two medical terms that sound the same – but are completely different. Rather like a pound second or a Newton second.  Which fatality rate, did you say?  First, there’s the Infection Fatality Rate IFR. This is the total number of people who are infected by a disease and the number of them who die. This figure includes those who have no symptoms at all, or only very mild symptoms – those who stayed at home, coughed a bit and watched Outbreak.  Then there’s the Case Fatality Rate CFR. This is the number of people suffering serious symptoms, who are probably ill enough to be in hospital. Clearly, people who are seriously ill – the “cases” – are going to have a higher mortality rate than those who are infected, many of whom don’t have symptoms. Put simply – all cases are infections, but not all infections are cases.  Which means that the CFR will always be far higher than the IFR. With influenza, the CFR is around ten times as high as the IFR. Covid seems to have a similar proportion.  Now, clearly, you do not want to get these figures mixed up. By doing so you would either wildly overestimate, or wildly underestimate, the impact of Covid. But mix these figures up, they did.  The error started in America, but didn’t end there. In healthcare, the US is very much the dog that wags the tail. The figures they come up with are used globally.  On February 28, 2020, an editorial was released by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC. Published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the editorial stated: “… the overall clinical consequences of Covid-19 may ultimately be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza.”  Also on rt.com ‘Corona World’ game backed by German public TV dehumanizes lockdown resisters & kids – but sure, what could go wrong?  They added that influenza has a CFR of approximately 0.1 percent. One person in a thousand who gets it badly, dies.  But that quoted CFR for influenza was ten times too low – they meant to say the IFR, the Infection Fatality Rate, for influenza was 0.1 percent. This was their fatal – quite literally – mistake.  The mistake was compounded. On March 11, the same experts testified to Congress, stating that Covid’s CFR was likely to be about one percent, so one person dying from a hundred who fell seriously ill. Which, as time has passed, has proved to be pretty accurate.  At this meeting, they compared the likely impact of Covid to flu. But they used the wrong CFR for influenza, the one stated in the previous NEJM editorial. 0.1 percent, or one in a thousand. The one that was ten times too low.  Flu toll 1,000 – Covid toll 10,000  So, they matched up the one percent CFR of Covid with the incorrect 0.1 percent CFR of flu. Suddenly, Covid was going to be ten times as deadly.  If influenza killed 50, Covid was going to kill 500. If influenza killed a million, Covid was going to get 10 million. No wonder Congress, then the world, panicked. Because they were told Covid was going to be ten times worse than influenza. They could see three million deaths in the US alone, and 70 million around the world.  I don’t expect you or I to get this sort of thing right. But I bloody well expect the experts to do so. They didn’t. They got their IFR and CFR mixed up and multiplied the likely impact of Covid by a factor of ten.  Here’s what the paper, “Public health lessons learned from biases in coronavirus mortality overestimation”,says: “On March 11, 2020,... based on the data available at the time, Congress was informed that the estimated mortality rate for the coronavirus was ten-times higher than for seasonal influenza, which helped launch a campaign of social distancing, organizational and business lockdowns, and shelter-in-place orders.”  On February 28 it was estimated that Covid was going to have about the same impact as a bad influenza season – almost certainly correct. Eleven days later, the same group of experts predicted that the mortality rate was going to be ten times as high. This was horribly, catastrophically, running-into-Mars-at-5,000-miles-an-hour wrong.  Enter the Mad Modellers of Lockdown  In the UK, the group I call the Mad Modellers of lockdown, the Imperial College experts, created the same panic. On March 16, they used an estimated IFR of 0.9 percent to predict that, without lockdown, Covid would kill around 500,000 in the UK.  Is this prediction anywhere close?  So far, the UK has had around 40,000 Covid deaths. Significantly less than 0.1 percent, but not that far off. Of course, people will say... “We had lockdown... without it so many more would have died. Most people have not been infected…” etc.  To answer this, we need to know the true IFR. Is it a 0.1 percent, or one percent? If it is one percent, we have more than 400,000 deaths to go. If it is 0.1 percent, this epidemic has run its course. For this year, at least.  With swine flu, remember that the IFR started at around two percent. In the end, it was 0.02 percent, which was five times lower than the lowest estimate during the outbreak. The more you test, the lower the IFR will fall.  Also on rt.com We might have to wait forever for science to show the Covid threat is over, so let’s use our common sense & get back to normal  So where can we look to get the current figures on the IFR? The best place to look is at the country that has tested more people than anywhere else as a proportion of their population: Iceland.  As of last week, Iceland’s IFR stood at 0.16 per cent. It cannot go up from here. It can only fall. People can’t start dying of a disease they haven’t got.  This means that we’ll probably end up with an IFR of about 0.1 percent, maybe less. Not the 0.02 percent of Swine Flu – somewhere between the two, perhaps. In short, the 0.1 percent prophecy has proved to be pretty much bang on.  Which means that we’ve had all the deaths we were ever going to get. And which also means that lockdown achieved, almost precisely nothing with regard to Covid. No deaths were prevented.  Mangled beyond recognition  Yes, we are testing and testing, and finding more so-called cases. As you will. But the hospitals and ICUs are virtually empty. Almost no-one is dying of Covid anymore, and most of those who do were otherwise very ill.  Instead of celebrating that, we’ve artificially created a whole new thing to scare ourselves with. We now call a positive test a Covid “case.” This is not medicine. A “case” is someone who has symptoms. A case is not someone carrying tiny amounts of virus in their nose.  Now, however, you test positive, and you’re a “case.” Never in history has medical terminology been so badly mangled. Never have statistics been so badly mangled.  When researchers look back at this pandemic, they’ll have absolutely no idea who died because of Covid, or who died –coincidentally– with it. Everything’s been mashed together in a determined effort to make the virus look as deadly as possible.  Lockdown happened because we were told that Coivid could kill one percent. But Covid was never going to kill more than about 0.1 percent – max.  That’s the figure estimated back in February, by the major players in viral epidemiology. A figure that has turned out to be remarkably accurate. Bright guys… bad mistake.  We’ve killed tens of thousands – for nothing  But because we panicked, we’ve added hugely to the toll. Excess mortality between March and May was around 70,000, not the 40,000 who died of/with Covid. Which means 30,000 may have died directly as a result of the actions we took.  We protected the young, the children, who are at zero risk of Covid. But we threw our elderly and vulnerable under a bus. The very group who should have been shielded. Instead, we caused 20,000 excess deaths in care homes.  It was government policy to clear out hospitals, and stuff care homes with patients carrying Covid, or discharge them back to their own homes, to infect their nearest and dearest. Or any community care staff who visited them.  We threw – to use health secretary Matt Hancock’s ridiculous phrase – a ring of steel around care homes. As it turned out, this was not to protect them, but to trap the residents, as we turned their buildings into Covid incubators. Anyone working in care homes, as I do, knows why we got 20,000 excess deaths. Government policy did this.  That is far from all the damage. On top of care homes, the ONS estimates that 16,000 excess deaths were caused by lockdown. The heart attacks and strokes that were not treated. The empty, echoing hospitals and A&E units. The cancer treatments stopped entirely.  Which means that at least as many people have died as a result of the draconian actions taken to combat Covid, as have been killed by the virus itself. This has been a slow-motion stampede, where the elderly – in particular - were trampled to death.  We locked down in fear. We killed tens of thousands unnecessarily, in fear. We crippled the economy, and left millions in fear of their livelihoods. We have trapped abused women and children at home with their abusers. We have wiped out scores of companies, and crushed entire industries.  We stripped out the NHS, and left millions in prolonged pain and suffering, on ever lengthening waiting lists, which have doubled. There have also been tens of thousands of delayed cancer diagnoses – the effects of which are yet to be seen, but the Lancet has estimated at least sixty thousand years of life will be lost.  Lockdown can be seen as a complete and utter disaster. And it was all based on a nonsense, a claim that Covid was going to kill one percent. A claim that can now be seen to be utterly and completely wrong. Sweden, which did not lock down, has had a death rate of 0.0058 percent.  It takes a very big person to admit they have made a horrible, terrible mistake. But a horrible, terrible mistake has been made. Let’s end this ridiculous nonsense now. And vow never to let such monumental stupidity happen ever again.

b100f125,Schools spending £1.3bn on supply teachers as staff shortage intensifies,"Cash-strapped schools are spending a record £1.3bn on supply staff as a result of a chronic shortage of teachers in the nation’s classrooms caused by the failure of the government’s recruitment policies, according to Labour.  At a time when schools are struggling with diminishing budgets and rising costs, the Labour party says spending on supply teachers has gone up by more than a quarter over two years as headteachers struggle to plug staffing gaps.  Labour analysis of new official government figures published last week shows spending on supply teachers – who are called in to cover in the absence of a member of staff – has gone up by almost £300m over two years, with the average amount spent by academies and free schools rising by 42% in a single year.  The figures come days after the scale of the teacher recruitment crisis was laid bare for MPs on the education select committee, who heard that schools were being forced to spend vast sums of money on recruitment agencies to help them fill vacancies.  Where schools would once have placed advertisements in the trade press, which would normally have attracted a selection of strong candidates, headteachers are spending up to £10,000 on agency fees to fill a single vacancy. Others are making expensive trips abroad to recruit.  Lucy Powell, the shadow education secretary, blamed the government’s failure to recruit enough trainee teachers, saying ministers had missed their target for teacher recruitment for the fourth year running.  “With chronic shortages of teachers in our schools, this government is risking the education of the next generation. Ministers have mishandled teacher training, putting applicants off and constantly talked down the profession, causing thousands of teachers to quit.    “As a result, half of all schools had unfilled positions at the start of this year and are being forced to turn to unqualified staff, temporary supply teachers, non-specialists and larger class sizes to try to plug the gaps.  “Nothing is more important for raising standards and improving social mobility than ensuring there are excellent teachers in every school. The government urgently needs to get a grip on this problem, which is affecting the education of our children, and start to take it seriously.”  A Conservative party spokesman accused Labour of scaremongering. “Lucy Powell has not had one positive thing to say about England’s schools and teaching profession since she became shadow education secretary,” the spokesman said.  “Despite many opportunities to laud the achievements of teachers and schools across England, which has seen 1.4 million more pupils in good or outstanding schools since 2010, Labour continue to scaremonger. Rather than recognise that the number and quality of teachers in our schools is at a record high, they talk down the teaching profession.”  Labour says the crisis is being worsened by record numbers of teachers leaving the profession, with 50,000 quitting this year alone – more than those who joined – and worse may be to come. A recent YouGov survey suggested that more than half of teachers 53% are considering giving up in the next two years. The main reasons given were “volume of workload” 61% and “seeking a better work/life balance” 57%.  However, the government claims that the number and quality of teachers is at a record high, with 1,000 more graduates training to teach in secondary schools than a year ago, and the number of former teachers returning to the classroom up from fewer than 15,000 in 2011 to more than 17,000 in 2014. Spending on supply teachers is up, the government says, because of rising pupil numbers.  A spokesperson for the Department for Education DfE said: “It is completely misleading to suggest there are chronic shortages of teachers or that a record number of teachers have ‘quit’ the profession – our increased spending on supply teachers simply reflects our increased total spending in response to rising pupil numbers.  “The overall teacher vacancy rate is 0.3% and has remained under 1% for the past 15 years. The 49,120 that left the profession between November 2013 and November 2014 includes those that left through death or retirement.”  Responding to the Labour figures, Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said the research echoed the NAHT recruitment survey, published last week, which showed that almost eight out of 10 school leaders are finding recruitment a problem.  “Supply teachers play a crucial role in addressing short-term gaps in teacher numbers, but an increasing number of school leaders are having to rely on them more frequently and for longer periods than in the past. These figures show an underlying problem in recruitment and retention that the government needs to address.”  There is a recognition from the government and those in the profession that as the economy picks up, competition to recruit graduates will increase. The government is offering bursaries and scholarships worth up to £30,000 tax-free, but many in the profession fear that the workload combined with pay and conditions make teaching unattractive.    The DfE spokesperson said supply teachers perform an important and valuable role. “Schools are best placed to make staffing decisions to reflect their individual needs. It is up to headteachers and governors to decide who is required for the job and this includes how best to cover absences.”  Of the just under 50,000 people who left the profession between November 2013 and November 2014, the DfE said more than 13,000 had either died or retired. “Our figures also show that the vast majority 72% of newly qualified teachers are still in post after five years,” the spokesperson said.",partially false
3c20c6d1,The CDC Confesses to Lying About COVID-19 Death Numbers,"Can any government statistics on COVID-19 deaths be trusted?  It is an open question now that we are learning that the highly respected, world-class Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC has been lying to us.  This revelation comes a few days after I wrote here at American Thinker that New York City was lying about COVID-19 deaths. The normal rules about reporting deaths have been violated by that city in the rush to inflate the body count, presumably to steer more taxpayer money to the Big Apple.  That the CDC isn’t telling the truth to Americans is no conspiracy theory: it’s right out there in the open for everyone to see. The CDC openly admits that it is fudging the COVID-19 death figures.  We know this because, among other truth-tellers, a plainspoken small-town physician from Kalispell, Montana, has pulled back the curtain.  Dr. Annie Bukacek, MD, explained in a presentation how death certificates are made. See “Montana physician Dr. Annie Bukacek discusses how COVID-19 death certificates are being manipulated,” YouTube, April 6  Why should anyone care how a certificate of death is made?  Everyone should care “today when governments are making massive changes that affect our constitutional rights and those changes are based on inaccurate statistics,” Bukacek says.  The system is deeply flawed, she argues.  Few people know how much individual power and leeway is given to the physician, coroner, or medical examiner, signing the death certificate. How do I know this? I've been filling out death certificates for over 30 years. More often than we want to admit, we don’t know with certainty the cause of death when we fill out death certificates. That is just life. We are doctors, not God. Autopsies are rarely performed and even when an autopsy is done the actual cause of death is not always clear. Physicians make their best guesstimate and fill out the form. Then that listed cause of death … is entered into a vital records data bank to use for statistical analysis, which then gives out inaccurate numbers, as you can imagine. Those inaccurate numbers then become accepted as factual information even though much of it is false.  This has been the way it has been done for some time, Bukacek says.  So even before we heard of COVID-19, death certificates were based on assumptions and educated guesses that go unquestioned. When it comes to COVID-19 there is the additional data skewer, that is –get this— there is no universal definition of COVID-19 death. The Centers for Disease Control, updated from yesterday, April 4th, still states that mortality, quote unquote, data includes both confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19. That’s from their website. Translation? The CDC counts both true COVID-19 cases and speculative guesses of COVID-19 the same. They call it death by COVID-19. They automatically overestimate the real death numbers, by their own admission. Prior to COVID-19, people were more likely to get an accurate cause of death written on their death certificate if they died in the hospital. Why more accurate when a patient dies in the hospital? Because hospital staff has physical examination findings labs, radiologic studies, et cetera, to make a good educated guess. It is estimated that 60 percent of people die in the hospital. But even [with] those in-hospital deaths, the cause of death is not always clear, especially in someone with multiple health conditions, each of which could cause the death.  Bukacek refers to a March 24 CDC memo from Steven Schwartz, director of the Division of Vital Statistics for the National Center for Health Statistics, titled “COVID-19 Alert No. 2.”  “The assumption of COVID-19 death,” she says, “can be made even without testing. Based on assumption alone the death can be reported to the public as another COVID-19 casualty.”  There is a question-and-answer section on the memo.  One question is, “Will COVID-19 be the underlying cause?”  The answer is: “The underlying cause depends upon what and where conditions are reported on the death certificate. However, the rules for coding and selection of the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause more often than not.”  Another question is, “Should ‘COVID-19’ be reported on the death certificate only with a confirmed test?”  The answer is:  “COVID-19 should be reported on the death certificate for all decedents where the disease caused or is assumed to have caused or contributed to death.” [Boldfacing in original]  “You could see how these statistics have been made to look really scary when it is so easy to add false numbers to the official database,” Bukacek says. “Those false numbers are sanctioned by the CDC.”  “The real number of COVID-19 deaths are not what most people are told and what they then think,” she says.  “How many people have actually died from COVID-19 is anyone’s guess … but based on how death certificates are being filled out, you can be certain the number is substantially lower than what we are being told. Based on inaccurate, incomplete data people are being terrorized by fearmongers into relinquishing cherished freedoms.”  It’s hard to argue with what Dr. Bukacek says, but no doubt angry social media mobs will find a way as her chilling words enlighten the populace that has been bullied into submission.  Of course, the disease’s body count is not the sole concern we should have about the Chinese contagion, but it is undeniably the primary driver of the rampant mass hysteria that has allowed state and local governments across America to crush our cherished civil liberties.  As they say in newsrooms: if it bleeds, it leads. Deaths are always going to be more “sexy” than confirmed cases. It is the number that really, really counts, and Americans know this.  The fraudulent death statistics also give ammunition to the legions of snitches and scolds who try to shame their fellow Americans for attending church or playing catch in an empty park or taking a harmless drive in the countryside to prevent themselves from going stir-crazy.  The fake death data from the CDC, coupled with wild guesstimates from experts, and the relentless barrage of fear porn the mainstream media subjects Americans to around the clock, have been getting results, even with a plague that is, so far at least, underperforming.  First, experts told us 2.2 million Americans would die. Then the number fell off a cliff, plunging down to around 200,000.  As of April 8, the number of those expected to die from the disease by August 4 was down to 60,000, or roughly a very nasty flu season. The new figure comes from the influential model produced by the University of Washington that the White House regularly cites.  Has social-distancing, wearing face masks, hosing down packages with bleach, using hand sanitizer that is at least 60 percent alcohol, and washing hands with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds helped bring the grim worst-case-scenario body count down?  Probably, I’m guessing, but it’s hard to know for sure.  Maybe those epidemiological modelers can be forgiven for scaring the bejeezus out of Americans. Epidemiology is not, after all, an exact science, as its practitioners sometimes acknowledge.  But those who have force-fed modelers skewed data that led to the terrifying death forecasts that stampeded governors into pushing the nation down the road to totalitarianism need to be held to account.  Let the investigations begin.

068d0644,Why is HealthSource RI concealing Governor Chafee's victory for abortion-on-demand?,"For immediate release:  October 2, 2013  For more information:  Barth E. Bracy, Executive Director  Office: 401 521-1860 / Mobile: 401 225-8646  Why is HealthSource RI concealing Governor Chafee's victory for abortion-on-demand?  Providence, RI-The Rhode State Island Right to Life Committee RIRTL wonders why HealthSource RI is concealing Governor Lincoln Chafee's hard-fought and unprecedented victory for government-subsidized abortion-on-demand and for mandatory abortion fees in Rhode Island's Obamacare exchange.  With HealthSource RI now operating, it appears that the 28 plans available for sale on the exchange 16 for small businesses, 12 for individuals and families fail to disclose the fact that they all include coverage for abortion-on-demand, that is, for abortions other than those in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the mother would be endangered.  According to RIRTL executive director Barth E. Bracy, We have been fighting in the General Assembly since 2011 trying to blunt Chafee's extreme agenda on government subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion-on-demand and, more recently, his imposition of a mandatory abortion fee on all Rhode Island individuals, families, and businesses who wish to purchase health insurance through HealthSource RI. Chafee's audacious yet constitutionally dubious end-run around the General Assembly has won the day for him and his fellow abortion-industry colleagues on the board of NARAL. Why are they trying to conceal their hard-fought victory?  Is Chafee worried, wonders Bracy that the lack of disclosure violates the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring plans that cover elective abortion to provide notice to enrollees as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation? Is he concerned that his exchange violates the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring the availability of at least one exchange-plan that does not provide coverage for elective abortion? Is he anxious that his administration might somehow have violated the provision of the Affordable Care Act that insurers cannot be required to provide coverage for elective abortion in their exchange-plans? Or is he simply aware that many Rhode Islanders would strongly disapprove of his machinations?  Under HealthSource RI, pro-life individuals, families, nonprofits, and small businesses are not free to purchase health insurance without paying a mandatory abortion fee, and thereby seriously violating their conscience and their principles. The Rhode Island State Right to Life Committee believes the citizens of Rhode Island deserve protection from this unprecedented government coercion and answers as to whether Chafee's mandatory abortion fee violates the law.  About Rhode Island Right to Life: Rhode Island Right to Life was founded in 1970 with the mission to advocate for a state, nation and world in which the innocent lives of the unborn, the disabled, the elderly and the ill are valued by the citizenry and protected by civil law.

3c15ac92,Victims of Voter Fraud: Initial Announcement of Deceased Georgians Used to Vote in 2020 General Election,"November 11, 2020 Victims of Voter Fraud: Initial Announcement of Deceased Georgians Used to Vote in 2020 General Election The American people deserve a free, fair, and fully transparent election in which every legal ballot is counted and every illegal ballot is not counted. Having confidence in our elections means knowing that votes are legally cast and that voters themselves are legally eligible to cast a ballot. Americans cannot have confidence in election results unless elected officials, law enforcement authorities, and fair-minded journalists take the issue of voter fraud seriously and investigate potential instances thoroughly. The Trump campaign will continue to bring these allegations to light, and the media and election authorities should vigorously examine them. Here are several examples in Georgia that should be investigated: Voter records show someone used the identity of Mrs. Deborah Jean Christiansen of Roswell, Georgia to vote in the recent election, even though Mrs. Christiansen passed away in May 2019. Further, someone registered Christiansen to vote on October 5, the day of the deadline to register, more than a year after she passed away. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution ran an obituary announcing Christiansen’s death at the time of her passing. Someone used the identity of James Blalock of Covington, Georgia to cast a ballot in last week’s election, even though Blalock died in 2006. Blalock’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution shortly after he passed away that year. Linda Kesler of Nicholson, Georgia died in 2003, but someone cast a ballot under her identity in last week’s election. Nicholson’s death notice ran in the Journal-Constitution when she passed away. Edward Skwiot of Trenton, Georgia is shown as having cast a ballot last week, even though he died in 2015. The Chattanooga Times Free Press ran a death notice in April of that year. These victims of voter fraud deserve justice, and legal voters should be able to have confidence that their votes are not rendered meaningless due to illegally cast votes.",partially false
2f57c81f,"At lawmakers’ urging, agency reveals report on growing bullet train costs","The California high-speed rail authority bowed to pressure from California legislators and members of Congress late Tuesday and released a copy of a 2013 report showing a large estimated increase in the cost of building the initial segment of the bullet train project.  The report, disclosed by the Times in a story Oct. 25, said Parsons Brinckerhoff had briefed state officials in October 2013 that the projected cost of the first phase of the bullet train system had risen 31%. The state did not use the increase, however, in its 2014 business plan four months later.  A dozen members of Congress and four members of the California assembly had written to the state and to Parsons Brinckerhoff asking for disclosure of the report.  Rail authority chairman Dan Richard and CEO Jeff Morales released the document and said the cost estimates it contained are part of an iterative process and that the numbers were “preliminary, still in development and subject to review clarification and refinement.” They say initial contracts have come in below budget.  Advertisement  “The authority under the present leadership has always been forthcoming about the costs and risks of the program,” Richard said.  Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins said rail authority officials have agreed to appear at an upcoming hearing.  Rep. Jeff Denham R-Turlock, chairman of the House rail subcommittee, wrote to Parsons Brinckerhoff on Tuesday asking for the document. “Given the magnitude of the project, we have questions regarding the stewardship of federal funds by the California High Speed Rail Authority,” said the letter, co-signed by 11 Republicans from districts across the state.  The report shows that the cost of building the first segment from Burbank to Merced had grown from $27.3 billion to $35.7 billion, not including future inflation. The state publishes most of its public cost figures with future inflation included, which would translate the cost of the initial segment from the current $31 billion to about $40 billion, based on the Parsons Brinckerhoff estimates.  Advertisement  Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter >>  The document also shows the cost of the entire project would increase by about 5%, going from $54.4 billion to $56.9 billion without inflation. If future inflation is included, based on the Parsons Brinckerhoff inflation estimates, the total project cost would go from $68 billion to more than $71 billion.  The Parsons Brinckerhoff cost estimate projected that some of the initial cost increases would be offset by later savings, though that may come too late to help the program.  The authority asserted that the Times misrepresented the nature of the document, because it was a PowerPoint that was marked draft. The 22-page document, however, contains a vast amount of specific cost data, broken down by geographic segments, specific type of construction activities and phases of the project.  Advertisement  The Richard letter also disputes The Times’ analysis of tunneling challenges through the San Gabriel and Tehachapi mountains, saying that the authority has some of the world’s best tunneling experts and that their consultants “have reiterated their comfort level with our schedule and our approach.”  The Times quoted geologists and engineers who said the plan to complete about 36 miles of mountain tunnels by a 2022 deadline for starting rail operations was unrealistic.  The Times requested the Parsons Brinckerhoff report under the California Public Records Act, but was turned down under a provision of the law that exempts disclosures that are not in the public interest. A senior rail authority executive, Dennis Trujillo, signed the denial letter.  The Times subsequently obtained the report from an individual close to the project.  Advertisement  The letter from the House Republicans was addressed to Gregory Kelly, chief executive of Parsons Brinckerhoff. Asked for a response, a company spokeswoman said, “We are proud of the service Parsons Brinckerhoff has delivered on the California High-Speed Rail project. Please contact the media relations office at the Rail Authority directly for a response to your inquiry.”  Members of the California Assembly had asked the speaker to subpoena the cost document. Assemblyman Jim Patterson, whose district includes Fresno, took the lead in a letter to Atkins. Patterson said he has lost confidence in the project.  “They have failed to disclose huge cost overruns and after they boasted private firms were interested in funding this project, we now know these firms are unwilling to put up any private money,” Patterson said. “What’s worse, we have learned that the [rail authority] ordered its own experts to keep their findings secret from the public.”  Richard, speaking on a Fresno radio talk show Tuesday, said the state is working to reduce the cost of the project below the current $68-billion estimate and that it has not withheld critical information from the public.  Advertisement  “The thing that offended me most about the [Times] article is that we have the most transparency of any agency,” Richard said.  Denham, however, said on the show that the state “continues to hide the facts.”  Denham has evolved into a potent critic of the project, as the Republican Party gained control of the House and then the Senate. He has vowed to cut any future funding for the project, which is facing at least a $16.3-billion shortfall to complete the initial operating segment by 2022.  ralph.vartabedian@latimes.com  Advertisement  Twitter: @rvartabedian  ALSO  Measure to restrict Airbnb rentals loses in San Francisco; Mayor Ed Lee reelected  LAPD to compile ‘much more comprehensive’ review of force, chief says  Advertisement  Pit bull Thor returns home to Texas after floods forced journey to California",partially false

a7b20877,Tlaib Files Lawsuit to Ban the American Flag in Schools,"Rashida Tlaib is busy at work during a national crisis that is keeping most school children at home. During this time, she’s decided to swoop in and take advantage of an already terrible situation.  She wants crews to move in on these schools, they let you do that when you’re a politician, and remove all of the American flags from every classroom in Michigan.  The argument for removing flags from all K-12 classrooms is simple. First, the lawsuit cites a rise in patriotism, which they feel must be “dealt with, stat.”  They also claim there are a number of kids at school who aren’t Americans and the flag makes them feel unwelcome.  In a new lawsuit filed in Michigan’s 9th Circuit Court, the filing states:  “Now is the time to end the discriminatory practice of having American flags in the classroom. There are many children who are either not American or don’t identify as Americans in our public schools. They have a right to attend a flag-free classroom.”  In addition, the Democrat politician also says the cost of these flags will free up the budget, which will allow a more diverse school lunch menu, that includes no pork, Halal, and Kosher meals.  The goal is to have all students returning to flag-free schools by this fall. They’ve also made it optional to replace the American flags in the classrooms with Rainbow Flags. Because they say kids love rainbow colors.  A spokesperson from the Federal Department of Education Joe Barron says:  “The Federal Government really needs to remain in our lane, so we cannot get involved in state matters. Just like we can’t act as a shipping company, we cannot act as the flag police. State rights matter.”  The fear is if Michigan gets away with this, other liberal states will follow. If the majority of the states do this, then the rules apply to all.  Share this:  Tweet",false

NHS consultant cardiologist and clean living campaigner Dr Aseem Malhotra said: These truly shocking figures reflect the gravest health crisis of our time, underpinned by a collective failure to give children the best start for a healthy life. This is due to a combination of factors including government failing to protect the public from the deliberate targeting of children by the junk food industry.

Before this the most reliable data was from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health earlier this year which said paediatric diabetes units were treating only 715 people under the age of 25 for Type 2. Vascular surgeon Martin Claridge, one of the UK's leading authorities on the condition, said: This is the tip of the iceberg. There are going to be many more young people out in the community who have not yet been diagnosed. As a society we appear to be sleep walking into this crisis.  Type 2 diabetes is caused by obesity, lifestyle and poor diet  Already more than one child in five is obese or overweight in their first year of primary school, illustrating the scale of the timebomb facing the NHS. There is already a sugar tax on some soft drinks but campaigners say it should be extended to food, and drinks not subject to the levy, like milkshakes, some of which contain as much as 16 teaspoons of sugar. Supermarkets regularly advertise promotions aimed at children with family packs of branded chocolate and biscuits available for just £1. Even sports organisations stand accused of making the crisis worse. McDonald's has been a key commercial partner of the Football Association for 15 years. And earlier this year the FA renewed its long-standing partnership with confectionary giant Mars, which makes Mars bars, Milky Way, M&Ms, Skittles, Snickers, and Twix. The company is now the official supporter of the England men's, women's and disabled teams. Campaigners want all labelling of added sugars to be marked in teaspoons rather than grams, all sugary drinks advertising on TV and internet demand services outlawed, and companies associated with sugary products to be banned from sponsoring sporting events.  Birmingham has been shamed as Britain's diabetes capital, where one in 10 now has the disease. Type 1 diabetes, which is suffered by Theresa May, is not caused by diet. But Type 2 often is. A lifelong condition, it leads to serious complications such as blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney failure It usually develops over the age of 40 in white Europeans or after 25 in people who are African-Caribbean, African, or South Asian. The condition is much more aggressive in children and young people than in adults, with a higher overall risk of complications that tend to appear much earlier. The risk of developing Type 2 is significantly increased by 33 percent being overweight or obese. Bridget Turner, Diabetes UK's director of policy and campaigns, said: Type 2 can be devastating for children and young people. To help shape a future where fewer children develop the condition, we need continued commitment across society to create an environment that reduces obesity. We need to encourage healthy living by providing viding Treating each clear and easy to understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar.  Ways to prevent becoming a diabetic  Overall, more than four million people in the UK have diabetes and a further 12 million living chronically unhealthy lifestyles are at increased risk of Type 2. The disease has become a huge drain on the NHS, costing £14billion a year to treat – or £1million every hour. The number of related prescriptions issued the disease year has rocketed by 80 percent in a decade. The Department of Health and Social Care said: We are committed to halving child obesity by 2030 and will be launching consultations to restrict promotions in shops for sugary and fatty foods, as well as a 9pm watershed ban on advertising. The upcoming NHS longterm plan will have prevention at its core.  How sufferers are affected Affecting around 90 percent of diabetes sufferers, Type 2 is usually caused by lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise and poor diet. It occurs when the body does not produce enough insulin or the hormone does not work properly, and is more common in people over the age of 30. Often diagnosed in childhood, Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that make insulin and it is not produced at all. As insulin regulates the amount of glucose allowed into the body, both types cause a build up of blood sugar that can cause serious health problems.  Consumption of too many sugary drinks can cause Type 2 diabetes  Sugary drinks cause a 'greater risk' Artificially sweetened drinks put people at a greater risk of developing Type 2 diabetes than other sugary foods, a study has warned. Researchers found that products with added fructose introduce excess nutrient poor energy into the diet and can have a harmful effect on blood sugar levels. However that was not the case with food and drink where fructose occurs naturally such as in whole fruit and juice, vegetables and honey. Previously it was unclear whether avoiding food where free sugars occur naturally could also be beneficial.  The current advice is just to reduce the amount of items where free sugars are added such as soft drinks, breakfast cereals, sweets and desserts. Researchers compiled results from 155 studies that looked into how different foods containing fructose sugars affect blood glucose levels in people with and without diabetes. They found most foods containing fructose sugars do not have a harmful effect on blood glucose levels as long as they do not provide too many calories. Fruit and juice may even have beneficial effects on blood glucose and insulin control, especially in people with diabetes. But foods that add excess nutrient poor energy to the diet, especially sweetened drinks, seem to have the most harmful effects on health. The researchers, based in the Canadian city of Toronto, said the higher fibre content of fruit could help to explain the improvements in blood glucose levels, as it slows down the release of sugars. Lead author Dr John Sievenpiper said more studies were needed but added: These findings might help guide recommendations on important food sources of fructose in diabetes prevention and management. Public health professionals should be aware harmful effects of fructose sugars on blood glucose seem to be mediated by energy and food source.  Only decisive action now will be able to halt crisis Comment by Robin Hewings WITH one in three children either overweight or obese before they leave primary school, it is now clearer than ever that bold, decisive action needs to be taken. In the latest chapter of its Childhood Obesity Plan, the Government laid out its commitment to halving childhood obesity by 2030. Our latest analysis provides yet more evidence that the Government, and industry, urgently need to turn these commitments into action. Type 2 diabetes is a serious, life-long condition that can lead to devastating complications. What we're seeing in these new figures is that obesity is driving this alarming increase in the number of children and young people with the condition, which is potentially setting them up for a lifetime of poor health.  Robin Hewings [twitter.com/RobinHewings]  The NHS must provide appropriate specialist services to support children with Type 2 to manage the condition and reduce the risk of serious complications. But the diabetes crisis is one that must be fought on many fronts. We want to see continued funding within the NHS for preventing Type 2 and a commitment to the improvement of care services which reflects the seriousness of this growing epidemic. And the fact is, we live in a society where making the healthy choice is not always the easy choice.",false
98344ef0,Appalling: Oprah Says That When Done “Right” Child Molestation Should Feel “Good” To Children,"Right Country – Oprah is part of this country’s elite and this country’s elite are full of pedophiles and perverts. She is no exception. The famous talk show host said that if a child molester is “any good” their victims won’t even know they’re being molested. It will “feel good” to children, Oprah claimed in a segment of one of her special’s on sexual abuse in 2017.  This is a downright disgusting thing to assert about child molestation. It’s doubtful that any victims of childhood molestation look back and think about how “good” it felt. Since Oprah made the comments in 2017 there was backlash and Oprah was forced to acknowledge such.  Here’s what Oprah’s website says in reference to the disturbing comments and one viewers perspective:  One comment Oprah made during her interview with four child predators touched a nerve with some viewers. During the discussion, Oprah said if an abuser does his or her job well, the abuse feels good. This can add to a victim’s feelings of shame and confusion. A survivor of sexual abuse, Diane, calls in to share a differing viewpoint, based on her own violent childhood. “I just wanted to make people aware that it’s not always that you’re going to feel good or get pleasure from [sexual abuse]. A lot of times, it’s fear and intimidation. It’s abuse,” she says. “It’s the fear of being beat again. It’s the abuser using abuse to get you to do what they want.” Diane says it never felt good from the first time she was raped at 9 years old until the abuse stopped just before her 13th birthday. “There was violence throughout my childhood,” she says. “He abused us enough that, when he said he was going to do something, we believed it.” Diane says she and her sister, who was abused by the same man, were intimidated into keeping their terrible secret. “When he said he would kill us, we believed him,” she says. Oprah says she understands where survivors like Diane are coming from. “There are many situations where that happens,” she says. “And as I’ve said before on this show, I’m speaking broadly and in, of course, general terms.”  Maybe Diane’s abuser was simply just not doing it “right.” Child molestation is supposed to “feel good” to children, apparently, not intimidate them or scare them. Diane just had a really lousy abuser.  Asserting that sexual abuse “feels good” to young children is just another attempt at normalizing it. How can it be that harmful, after all, if it feels good. Convincing young children that sexual abuse, when done “right,” should feel good is an appalling and disgusting way to desensitize children to abuse.  Since Oprah launched the series meant to bring awareness to sexual abuse she has spoken with numerous victims and even convicted child molesters. One of these child molesters explained when he was 10 or 11 he was groomed and subsequently molested and then grew up to then follow in those same footsteps.  Grooming is a psychologically damaging process to any child and it’s the very reason why so many victims of child sexual abuse end up abusing children when they grow up. That’s exactly why it’s so dangerous to put out ideas like when child molesting is done “right” it “feels good.”",false
121b885c,Truvada,"When Truvada and other similar HIV medications came onto the U.S. market in 2001, Gilead led patients to believe these antiviral medications were safe to take. And more importantly, taking Truvada was a smart way to help protect yourself from HIV. What patients weren’t told was that Truvada could cause an increased risk of bone density problems and kidney failure.  A 2012 study conducted by doctors at the University of California – San Francisco UCSF found that the risk of chronic kidney disease increased by 33% each year that a patient took Truvada.  In response, a Gilead executive told the Wall Street Journal that the study “overstates some of the risks.”  If you were you prescribed Truvada, Atripla, Complera, Stibild or Viread when other equally effective medications without potentially dangerous side effects could have been taken, it is not okay.",partially false
6183dd49,Brexit vote pushes up price of bacon as China hoovers up British pork,"Brexit is pushing up the price of a bacon butty as China exploits the weak pound to hoover up British pork amid its own domestic shortage.  China’s farming industry has been devastated by severe flooding, which has forced suppliers to look further afield for their pork.  The added demand from China has pushed up EU pork exports to the People’s Republic by 60%, to reach 1.2m tonnes in the first six months of the year.  Much of China’s appetite has been sated by British meat exports, which have become cheaper for foreign buyers thanks to the weakness of sterling following the Brexit vote.  The result has been a 40,000-tonne rise in pig meat exports, up 31% on the first half of last year.  Some shop suppliers have raised their prices by up to 38%, according to purchasing company Beacon, causing price increases at the till of up to 19%, as supermarkets pass the cost on to consumers. It added that high prices would persist.  “The combination of such huge demand for British pork from China and the devaluing of sterling following Brexit is impacting our breakfast tables,” said Emma Warrington, a senior food buyer at Beacon.  “Figures from our butchery suppliers show the price of British bacon rising, in some cases substantially, with data from [butcher] Birtwistles showing that the spike in demand was equal to an additional 30,000 tonnes in the first six months of 2016.  “All of this means we might be paying a higher price for a bacon sandwich for the foreseeable future.”  China’s paucity of pigs has been caused by severe floods, which have affected millions of people and left pig farmers struggling to protect their livestock.  The European farming industry has also felt the effect of flooding, which Beacon warned could pile on the misery for anyone who likes chips with their bacon butty.  It said the floods had affected potato crop quality and quantity, which is set to drive up prices for chips and other potato products.    Britain’s vote to leave the European Union – and the subsequent drop in the value of sterling – has triggered a string of warning about the cost of goods, including supermarket produce, holidays and bottles of wine.    The Consumer Prince Index measure of inflation reached 0.6% in July, the highest level in 20 months, with many economists saying the effect on inflation has yet to be felt in full.  Some industries such as domestic tourism are reporting benefits as the weak pound makes the UK a more attractive place for foreign visitors. Swiss luxury watch firms have reported a boom in tourists buying timepieces in the UK.  The most recent health-check on the state of the UK’s manufacturing sector also lent some weight to claims that the weakness of the pound will prove a boon to exporters.  Manufacturing exports rose to their highest level in two years in the three months to the end of July, according to quarterly survey data from the Confederation of British Industry.  But economists have warned not to read too much into one export figure. The CBI said it was not all good news for UK firms that do business with overseas clients.  The business lobby group said the currency effect was a “double-edged sword”, with manufacturers likely to feel the pinch as the cost of imported materials rises.",false
a85f1aac,"US Under Military Law, Congress Arrested, War With CCP Won and No One Knows It","US Under Military Law, Congress Arrested, War With CCP Won and No One Knows It      Joe Biden was sworn in as president of a bankrupt and defunct US Inc. Corporation. Just prior to his pre-recorded-in-Hollywood-by-Castle Rock Entertainment Inauguration, Washington DC, Capitol Hill and the White House were secured within miles of barbed wire fences and 60,000 National Guard troops.  Now over a week later, over 30,000 troops and the barbed wire fencing remained. Why?  An answer came early Mon. morning 25 Jan. when from 3am to 6am arrests of 80 to 140 Congress people appeared to be underway at Capitol Hill – after which Congress seemed to have disappeared. Why? https://www.bitchute.com/video/oYzu0wcwa3GE/ House cancels business during first full Biden week – Washington Times US Military at the White House Arresting Congress | Politics | Before It’s News  In reality an Interim Military US Government had taken over Washington DC and was running our country. The two US governments: 1 a legitimate Interim Military US Government empowered by the Constitution and the Department of Defense under Military Code 11.3, and 2 an illegal, fraudulent foreign paid-for, foreign controlled on the foreign ground of the District of Columbia Biden Administration.  The US Military appeared to be in charge of Biden and making him sign blank Executive Orders on a stage set of the Oval Office. The White House was said to be empty. Why? https://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=164754  The whole operation began way last Jan. 2020 during a government shutdown. President Trump was said to have reorganized several agencies including the US Treasury, IRS and Federal Reserve. Now the US Military had control of all assets including taxpayer dollars at the new US Treasury near Reno. Why?  The Military had been tasked with conducting a return to a gold/asset-backed dollar and to insure that the US Republic was restored to original laws of the Constitution as written prior to 1871. http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/forum.cgi?read=115613  This was all made possible after a Sat. 9 Jan 2021 raid by US Military Special Op Teams on CIA Headquarters in Langley Virginia. The raid produced firm evidence that the CIA, Democrats and other traitors had conspired with foreign entities led by the Chinese Communist Party CCP, to interfere in the 2020 Election.  Earlier that Saturday morning 9 Jan. there had been two attempts on Trump and his wife Melania’s lives there were said to have been twelve plus such attempts since he gained office.  Trump had had enough. He immediately instigated the Insurrection Act put into law by George Bush Jr. after 9/11, and then turned his authority over to the US Military.  With the nation now under Martial Law, Trump would remain as US President until all those who committed treason were arrested, including those who certified the illegal 2020 Election.  Some in the Pentagon had been preparing for this for over twenty years. US Attorney General for Utah John Huber and his 740 investigators had been very busy since 2016. The US government was corrupt throughout including Congress and the three letter agencies. There were a lot of traitors whose cases had already been processed through State Grand Juries. There was an estimated 80 to 140 Congress people thought named in over 223,000 sealed indictments filed in federal courts since Trump took office.  Of those, 85% to 95% indicted were Democrats, intermixed with a few Rino Republicans. The majority of charges were said to be pedophilia, child exploitation, misappropriation of US Taxpayer funds and conspiring with foreign powers to influence the 2020 Presidential Election – an act of Treason. Some serious charges couldn’t be brought because Obama pardoned so many in his last days in office.  By Jan. 2 2020 Military Tribunals were said to have already began at GITMO for high profile elites such as the Clintons, Obamas and Bushes. Charges against them were believed to include Capital High Treason, Election Fraud, Child Sex Trafficking, Money Laundering, Misappropriation of US Taxpayer Funds, plus Uranium One, 9/11 and Benghazi crimes.  Deep State Special prosecutor Robert Mueller was believed to have been charged for his involvement in the 9/11 cover-up he was appointed FBI Director 7 days before 9/11 and oversaw 9/11 so-called “investigations”, plus he conducted an ongoing fake Russian witch-hunt against Trump. https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/168059921/  It was no wonder the Democrats wanted to impeach Trump, again. On Thurs. 28 Jan. certain traitors in both the House and Senate did in fact recognize Trump as the acting US President when they voted, again, to try to impeach him. Under rules of the Constitution you could not impeach a US President if he didn’t presently hold the office.  Donald Trump wasn’t worried about being impeached from the presidency of the bankrupt and defunct US Corporation. He had other plans. On 11 Jan. 2021 Donald Trump was inaugurated as head of the Patriot or Constitutional Party, which made him a candidate for US President, again.  The US Military was about to restore the US Republic to laws underlying the original Constitution as written prior to 1871. That election was planned to be held on 4 March 2021 through use of a transparent, secure and instantaneous Quantum Voting Computer where citizens could vote using their own computers, or phones.  For many years the Chinese Communist Party not the Chinese government, which was working to become a democracy had been involved in a takeover of America. That war culminated when just prior to the 2020 US Presidential Election, the CCP bought Dominion Voting machines that through use of an Italian satellite loaned with money at the Vatican, threw what was believed to be millions of Trump votes to Biden. And, the CIA raid proved it all.  The war between the CCP and the US actually ended on Thurs. 28 Jan. Former Navy Intelligence officer Simeon Parkes reported a showdown in the South China Sea. The CCP had been trying to take over Taiwan. Taiwan was where gold was stored that would back countries including the US, for a Global Currency Reset. Parks said that there were air battles between America and Taiwan fighter jets against CCP jets and “the CCP lost big time.”  The New World Order fans had lost their war. A banker source out of Zurich said they had promised to settle everything by Fri. 29 Jan. https://www.simonparkes.org/blog  Rinus Verhagen reported that “the CCP has abandoned their Big Restart Operation and the liberal elite-scheduled reboot of Globalism has failed. Operation COVID-19, expressed in the book “Great Restoration” by Klaus Schwab, President of the Davos Global Economic Forum, has also failed. The CCP would not impose a Global Order. Their power, like any commercial empire, was limited to an economic expansion.” http://www.takecare4.eu/panic-in-dc/ Take care 4 –  Please Support beforeitsnews, By Trying Some Of Our Health Products, By Following This Link To Our Health Supplement Store!

7ed4b953,Democrat Insider: Anti-Trump Postal Workers In GOP Neighborhoods Throw Mail-In Ballots In The Garbage,"🚨 POLL: Do mail-in ballots make voter fraud too easy?  Vote Now Yes No  A Democrat operative revealed that the United States Postal Service USPS workers who share a mutual disdain for the 45th President, Donald Trump, will sometimes help election fraudsters by throwing in the garbage mail-in ballots from Republican-heavy neighborhoods, according to Breitbart News.  A Democrat operative told the New York Post‘s Jon Levine a number of stories in which insiders like him lead teams of fraudsters to commit election fraud by paying homeless voters off, taking advantage of the elderly, posing as registered voters, and printing up fake ballots.  “You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy and he’s working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold … He can take those [filled-out] ballots, and knowing 95% are going to a Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.” [Emphasis added]  “You have a postman who is a rabid anti-Trump guy and he’s working in Bedminster or some Republican stronghold … He can take those [filled-out] ballots, and knowing 95% are going to a Republican, he can just throw those in the garbage.”  “In some cases, mail carriers were members of his “work crew,” and would sift ballots from the mail and hand them over to the operative.”  “At this point, we can confirm that a small number of military ballots were discarded,” DOJ officials said in a statement:  “Investigators have recovered nine ballots at this time. Some of those ballots can be attributed to specific voters and some cannot. Of the nine ballots that were discarded and then recovered, seven were cast for presidential candidate Donald Trump. Two of the discarded ballots had been resealed inside their appropriate envelopes by Luzerne [County] elections staff prior to recovery by the FBI and the contents of those 2 ballots are unknown.”  The disturbing tactic was most recently used in the swing district of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and Justice Department DOJ say mail-in ballots by members of the United States Armed Forces cast for Trump were “discarded.”  More from Breitbart:",false

A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military.  Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat.

Kraken is a Department of Defense cyber warfare program that tracks and hacks other systems to acquire evidence of nefarious actions of other nations & enemies.  #Breaking #BreakingNews ￼🚨💥🚨 #Wikileaks has dumped 8,761 CIA Documents on Tuesday revealing CIA base in #Frankfurt #Germany which was used to hack elections incl “malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ‘zero day’ exploits, malware remote control systems and associated docs.-> pic.twitter.com/csym4eiGl9  “This may be why, as the Gateway Pundit reports, the CIA was kept completely out of the server raid operation rumored in Germany. The raid was likely leveled against the CIA’s own server farm that ran the remote Dominion-Scytl hacking operation the night of the election!”  “It reported the Americans had also established a dense network of outposts and shell companies in Frankfurt. It appears the CIA was using the same foreign data center to hack the US elections… and got caught.”  Wikileaks has dumped 8,761 CIA Documents on Tuesday revealing CIA base in Frankfurt #Germany which was used to hack elections incl “malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized ‘zero day’ exploits, malware remote control systems and associated docs.->  CIA Hacking Tools Revealed  Wikileaks: Vault 7  Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named “Vault 7” by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.  The first full part of the series, “Year Zero”, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA’s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.  Recently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, trojans, weaponized “zero day” exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.  “Year Zero” introduces the scope and direction of the CIA’s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of “zero day” weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple’s iPhone, Google’s Android and Microsoft’s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.  Since 2001 the CIA has gained political and budgetary preeminence over the U.S. National Security Agency NSA. The CIA found itself building not just its now infamous drone fleet, but a very different type of covert, globe-spanning force — its own substantial fleet of hackers. The agency’s hacking division freed it from having to disclose its often controversial operations to the NSA its primary bureaucratic rival in order to draw on the NSA’s hacking capacities.  By the end of 2016, the CIA’s hacking division, which formally falls under the agency’s Center for Cyber Intelligence CCI, had over 5000 registered users and had produced more than a thousand hacking systems, trojans, viruses, and other “weaponized” malware. Such is the scale of the CIA’s undertaking that by 2016, its hackers had utilized more code than that used to run Facebook. The CIA had created, in effect, its “own NSA” with even less accountability and without publicly answering the question as to whether such a massive budgetary spend on duplicating the capacities of a rival agency could be justified.  In a statement to WikiLeaks the source details policy questions that they say urgently need to be debated in public, including whether the CIA’s hacking capabilities exceed its mandated powers and the problem of public oversight of the agency. The source wishes to initiate a public debate about the security, creation, use, proliferation and democratic control of cyberweapons.  Once a single cyber ‘weapon’ is ‘loose’ it can spread around the world in seconds, to be used by rival states, cyber mafia and teenage hackers alike.  Julian Assange, WikiLeaks editor stated that “There is an extreme proliferation risk in the development of cyber ‘weapons’. Comparisons can be drawn between the uncontrolled proliferation of such ‘weapons’, which results from the inability to contain them combined with their high market value, and the global arms trade. But the significance of “Year Zero” goes well beyond the choice between cyberwar and cyberpeace. The disclosure is also exceptional from a political, legal and forensic perspective.”  Wikileaks has carefully reviewed the “Year Zero” disclosure and published substantive CIA documentation while avoiding the distribution of ‘armed’ cyberweapons until a consensus emerges on the technical and political nature of the CIA’s program and how such ‘weapons’ should analyzed, disarmed and published.  Wikileaks has also decided to redact and anonymise some identifying information in “Year Zero” for in depth analysis. These redactions include ten of thousands of CIA targets and attack machines throughout Latin America, Europe and the United States. While we are aware of the imperfect results of any approach chosen, we remain committed to our publishing model and note that the quantity of published pages in “Vault 7” part one “Year Zero” already eclipses the total number of pages published over the first three years of the Edward Snowden NSA leaks.",false
5dc31757,New Mexico House Committee Passes Bill to Legalize Killing Babies in Abortions Up to Birth,"New Mexico lawmakers are swiftly on their way toward legalizing the killing of unborn babies in abortions up to birth for years to come.  The Daily Post reports the state Health and Human Services Committee passed House Bill 7 with bipartisan support on Wednesday. The vote was 8-3, and the bill now heads to the state House Judiciary Committee.  The pro-abortion bill would repeal a 1969 statute that prohibits abortions except in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s life. The statute is not in effect because of Roe v. Wade, but if it is repealed, the state would continue to allow unborn babies to be aborted for any reason up to birth even if Roe is overturned.  It also would repeal the only conscience protections for pro-life medical workers in New Mexico. Currently, the law protects doctors, nurses and other medical workers from discrimination if they refuse to abort an unborn baby based on “moral or religious grounds.”  A state Senate committee passed an almost identical bill earlier this week.  However, pro-life leaders and medical workers are pushing back, saying the bill would strip away vital protections for healthcare workers, babies and mothers.  “Regardless of your position on abortion, no one should be forced to participate, to violate her most deeply held principles or the reason she entered the medical field – to save lives,” Catherine Glenn Foster, president of Americans United for Life, told the committee prior to the vote.  Foster said tens of thousands of healthcare providers in New Mexico would lose their conscience rights and they could sue the state for violating their religious freedom.  During a Senate hearing earlier in the week, state Sen. Gregg Schmedes, R-Sandoval, warned that doctors may leave New Mexico if the bill passes.  “Though some of the existing law is unenforceable because of Roe v. Wade, this statute contains important provisions that protect our doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals,” Schmedes said, according to the Los Alamos Reporter. “As a medical doctor, I have heard from many of my colleagues that if they lose these vital conscience protections, they will consider leaving the state which would threaten healthcare access for many New Mexicans.”  But state Rep. Micaela Lara Cadena, D-Mesilla, a sponsor of the bill, argued that the 1969 statute needs to be repealed because it is “outdated and dangerous.”  “Pregnant people and their families deserve continued access to safe and legal abortion,” Cadena said. “By repealing this dangerous statute, we are making sure this ban is never enforceable in New Mexico again.”  The AP predicts the bill will pass the Democrat-controlled state legislature. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a pro-abortion Democrat, also supports it.  But pro-lifers are not giving up hope. Elisa Martinez, executive director of the New Mexico Alliance for Life, urged New Mexico residents to call their lawmakers and urge them to reject the bill.  “The radical abortion lobby seeks to force medical professionals across New Mexico to perform abortions as a matter of ‘access.’ This is not a pro-woman bill but rather, a pro-abortion lobby bill,” Martinez said.  In 2019, a bipartisan group of lawmakers defeated a similar pro-abortion bill in the state Senate. However, many of the Democrat lawmakers who voted against it no longer serve in the legislature.  The bill is similar to laws that passed recently in New York, Vermont, Massachusetts and Rhode Island. New Jersey also is considering a bill to expand the killing of unborn babies in abortions this year.  Action: Contact New Mexico state lawmakers.",false

1502bd12,Biden Says the Second Amendment is ‘Obsolete’,"During the Republican National convention, President Trump spent a lot of time covering the dangers and ill-advised policies of a Biden administration. An America under the supervision of the radical Democrat candidate seems, at least to his watchful eye, a disaster in the making with our very lives and freedoms in serious jeopardy.  Just recently, Biden confirmed one of those very fears during a campaign speech at the Joe Barron Jewish community center in Pohtaytoe, Virginia, referring to the sacred and God-blessed second amendment right of all Americans to own and use firearms at any time anywhere for any reason whatsoever as “obsolete.” Clearly, this is either a case of Trump being right on the money, or a satirical article to drive gullible trumpers into blood pressure fits.  Supporters of the President constitute the country’s least educated and most violently gullible of citizens, and do, in fact, believe idiotic things about the amendment that are laughably untrue. Such as that it’s purpose is to fight the government should it become tyrannical. Sure, Jethro, they went through all the work of designing a country and government the likes of which the world had never seen, and then put in a self-destruct button in case you didn’t want to wear a mask, you pussy.  The truth is, there have only been two times the second amendment has been threatened in recent memory. The first was when Trump himself suggested “taking the guns and worrying about the legal stuff later.” The second was when Trump lied and said that Biden was coming after it. To no great shock, Trump’s parade of happy dipshits ignored the first and blew their own balls off about the second.  The history of gun-grabbing is long and storied, and always pushed as a fear tactic by republicans. Although the total number of guns confiscated by democrats remains at a steady “0”, it doesn’t stop the gullible from believing.",false
e21d7e94,"As commission ponders legislator pay raises, opinions differ between upstate and downstate","The panel formed to consider proposed pay raises for New York State legislators has until mid November to submit its recommendation. There are differences in opinion among lawmakers, downstate and upstate, whether they need to earn larger checks.  WBFO's Michael Mroziak reports.  State lawmakers currently earn $79,500 per year. The commission now pondering a pay raise for lawmakers is said to be considering a 47 percent increase, which would raise legislator salaries to nearly $119,000 annually.  The panel, which previously recommended a $29,000 increase in annual pay for judges, has until November 15 to decide on legislators' pay.  The state constitution requires lawmakers earn the same wage. Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie is among the downstate lawmakers hoping for a raise. A Bronx native, Heastie points to a higher cost of living in that part of New York State.  When the salary was 79-thousand five-hundred, that purchasing power has now been reduced to 53-thousand dollars, said Heastie during a visit to Buffalo late last week. Legislators have children that they need to help go to college. They have real lives.  Some of Heastie's peers, though, are satisfied with what they're earning now. Buffalo-based Assemblyman Sean Ryan is among those not supporting a raise. However, he appreciates why his downstate colleagues want one.  We happen to be attached to a state that has one of the highest costs of living in only a part of the state, said Ryan. That's why it's been an issue that's been struggled with for 19 years and there's been no changes made.  Some argue that allowing the salary increase might motivate lawmakers to agree to reforms. Ryan does not want one to become a condition for the other.  That's not the path we want to go down, he said. We've been talking about ethics reform for the last three years now. We keep making baby steps towards it but the big steps we have to take are to limit outside income, and we need to reduce the amount of money you are allowed to give to a candidate.  Heastie suggested that if salaries are not adjusted for current cost of living, many good candidates may choose to decline running for office.  If you don't have requisite pay, you're going to really shrink the talent pool where you're probably only going to have the very wealthiest of New Yorkers to run for public office, Heastie said.",partially false
45ef7d05,Energy secretary warns of £500m 'electric shock' after Brexit,"Energy bills would soar by £500m a year if the UK left the EU, Amber Rudd, the energy secretary, will claim on Thursday.  In remarks dismissed by leave campaigners as “absurd”, the cabinet minister will deliver the latest in a series of warnings from senior government figures about the costs of Brexit.  These have included claims that 600,000 jobs in the drinks industry would be safer inside the EU and that lamb and beef farmers could face an extra £330m a year bill to export their goods.  In a speech, Rudd will say the UK’s membership of the EU has “helped keep our energy bills down”.  “If we left the European Internal Market, we’d get a massive electric shock because UK energy costs are likely to rocket by at least half a billion pounds a year – the equivalent of British bills going up by around £1.5m pounds each and every day,” she will say.  She cited a report, commissioned by the National Grid, which she said found that leaving the EU, and exiting the internal energy market, could cost consumers £500m or more each year. This is the equivalent of £20 per household – or about a third less when business consumption is taken into account.  The EU also provides a protection against being bullied by Vladimir Putin over Russian gas, Rudd will tell employees during a visit to the site of an interconnector pipeline in Kent, which brings electricity supplies from the continent.  “Relying on energy from abroad is not without risk. We have seen how countries such as Putin’s Russia use their gas supplies as a tool of foreign policy. Threatening to cut off supplies or drastically increase prices,” she will say.    “We can’t let our energy security be hijacked as a political pawn to bring Europe to its knees. By working together in the European Union each member state can stop this becoming a reality.  “As a bloc of 500 million people, we have the power to force Putin’s hand. We can coordinate our response to a crisis. We can use the power of the internal market to source gas from elsewhere. We can drive down the price of imports, as has happened recently in eastern Europe.    “To put it plainly – when it comes to Russian gas, united we stand, divided we fall.”  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said: “Amber Rudd’s absurd claims simply aren’t backed up by her own research.  “It is quite extraordinary the extent to which the government is willing to do down Britain in its desperate attempt to win the referendum. In fact the EU makes our energy bills more expensive and costs us £350m a week.  “If we want cheaper bills, less commission interference and the ability to spend our money on our priorities, then the safe option is to Vote Leave.”",false
3886ead8,Breaking: Breonna Taylor’s boyfriend says SHE opened fire on cops,"The bombshell claim comes from over 20 hours of Grand Jury testimony released on Friday in the Breonna Taylor case.  Taylor has become the most prominent example from the media, politicians and celebrities that law enforcement must reform from systematic racism.  Much of those claims were already falling apart before today’s news. Taylor was not sleeping in her bed as was suggested but next to her boyfriend in the hallway as officers were being shot at.  Cops were not at the wrong house as was suggested but rather Taylor was the focus of a months long investigation as conspiring with her ex-boyfriend to receive mail and money from an alleged drug operation.  Also revealed months ago was Taylor being interviewed by law enforcement after a car she had rented contained a homicide victim.  According to the Daily Mail, the Grand Jury was presented with evidence that at the scene, Taylor’s boyfriend told cops that it was in fact Taylor that shot at cops.  Among the recordings released is Officer Brett Hankison’s interview with investigators that said Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, had told him ‘she was the one who shot at us’.  Walker later confessed that he was the one who opened fire.  One of Taylor’s neighbors also told investigators that police had told her that ‘some drug-dealing girl shot an officer’.  Officers had a ‘no-knock’ warrant to search Taylor’s apartment for drugs the night when she she was killed and the mainstream media has pushed the false claim that they are “illegal”, and in turn several agencies have abandoned the practice.  In fact, while the warrant was “no knock”, testimony from officers and witnesses revealed that law enforcement spent almost a minute knocking and announcing before using a ram to enter the residence.  ‘We knocked on the door, said police, waited I don’t know 10 or 15 seconds. Knocked again, said police, waited even longer,’ Louisville, Kentucky, police Lt. Shawn Hoover said in an interview recorded the day Taylor was shot.  ‘So it was the third time that we were approaching, it had been like 45 seconds if not a minute,’ Hoover said. ‘And then I said, ‘Let’s go, let’s breach it’.’  In an interview with investigators that was played to the grand jury, Walker said that if officers had announced themselves, ‘it changes the whole situation because there was nothing for us to be scared of.’  One law enforcement officer testified that police ultimately never executed the warrant to search Taylor’s apartment.  ‘Were drugs money or paraphernalia recovered from apartment 4? … The answer to that is no,’ the officer said on the recording.  ‘They didn’t go forward with executing the initial search warrant that they had for Breonna Taylor’s apartment.’  Police used a narcotics warrant to enter Taylor’s Louisville apartment on March 13. The 26-year-old emergency medical worker, was shot five times.  Cameron said two officers who fired their guns, hitting Taylor, were justified because Taylor’s boyfriend had shot at them first. The boyfriend has said he thought someone was breaking in.  The grand jury did charge fired Officer Brett Hankison with three counts of wanton endangerment for shooting into a neighboring apartment. No one was hit.  While the additional information may be shocking to some, what should be more of a concern is the “breaking” story from a foreign media outlet which only shows just how corrupt the American media is.  The same media that never demanded body camera footage in the George Floyd case or even bothered to report that the “neck” restraint was an approved tactic by the agency, are the same ones trying to convince the world that Taylor was simply an innocent girl sleeping in her bed.  We agree with Journalist Jason Whitlock. Indeed, what happened to Taylor is tragic, but to overlook a series of bad decisions on her part to allegedly associate with a known drug dealer and help assist his operation and blame the cops for executing a legal search warrant where they were shot, is plain ridiculous.",false

The father of Kamala Harris detailed how their ancestors owned slaves.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  The Democrats have been up in arms about an NBC News report that detailed how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s great-great-grandfathers owned slaves in Alabama in the 1800s.  Donald Harris, a Stanford University economics professor and father of 2020 Democrat candidate, wrote about how they are descendant of an Irishman who owned a slave plantation in Jamaica in a piece titled “Reflections of a Jamaican Father.”  “My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown’s Town,” Mr. Harris wrote in his article for Jamaica Global.  The Free Beacon reports that “a research archive of Jamaican records indicate that at one point in 1817, Hamilton Brown owned scores of slaves. The majority were brought in from Africa, though he also owned many Creole slaves.”  Harris has been pushing for “some form of reparations for black people,” saying that “we have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities.” Something her own family history reflects.  McConnell has responded to the reports about his ancestors by pointing out that the family of former President Barack Obama also owned slaves.  “You know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,” McConnell said. “We both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.”",true

ed8a09ac,Ministers are undermining trust in foreign aid by failing to ensure it is spent on world’s poorest,"Ministers are undermining trust in foreign aid by failing to ensure it is spent on the world’s poorest, MPs have warned.  Projects funded through the £14billion budget include schemes to boost China’s film industry and to improve its museums.  Britain is legally committed to spending 0.7 per cent of gross national income on foreign aid, but the Commons international development committee called for that money to be focused on poverty reduction.  MPs singled out the £600million Prosperity Fund, a cross-Whitehall pot that is still used to pay for foreign aid schemes in India and China.  MPs singled out the £600million Prosperity Fund, a cross-Whitehall pot that is still used to pay for foreign aid  They raised questions about how it was funding projects in China to reduce tobacco consumption by migrant workers and to lower the salt intake of children.  The MPs said many of the dubious ventures were being run by Boris Johnson’s Foreign Office FCO. ‘Among the FCO-administered Prosperity Fund projects, we found many weaker examples including projects to develop the Chinese film industry, improve the Chinese museum infrastructure and improve the credit bond rating system in China,’ they said.  The committee said it was unclear ‘how these types of interventions will benefit the very poorest people’. It called for a review of existing programmes.  ‘We are concerned to have uncovered Prosperity Fund projects within middle-income countries which show inadequate, or negligible, targeting at improving the lives of the very poorest and most vulnerable communities in these countries,’ the report said.  Whitehall departments were also condemned for not being open about how they are doling out the £14billion budget.  Although most of the foreign aid budget is used by the Department for International Development Dfid, other Government departments are increasingly having to help to get the money out the door.  More than a quarter 27.5 per cent of the aid budget was spent by departments other than Dfid last year.  The report said while Dfid was ‘respected worldwide as an accountable deliverer of aid’, there was a lack of transparency elsewhere in Whitehall.  The committee warned that other Government departments were being given aid money to spend without having to explain how they would make sure it was used properly.  The MPs said many of the dubious ventures were being run by Boris Johnson’s Foreign Office  The MPs said yesterday: ‘Given the level of spending involved, we are concerned that departments are not publishing fuller details of their... spending as this lack of clarity clouds the public’s ability to see good and bad spending.’  They highlighted the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund CSSF, which redacts information and refuses to publish how it uses much of its money.  The MPs added: ‘This lack of clarity undermines trust in the fund.’  A Government spokesman said: ‘We have been clear, we must ensure that the aid budget is not just spent well but could not be spent better and standards are raised across Government to achieve value for taxpayers’ money.’",true
0ab93637,80% of the nuns in this Kentucky convent got COVID 2 days after vaccine,"Big Tech is censoring us. Subscribe to our email list and bookmark LifeSiteNews.com to continue getting our news. Subscribe now. VILLA HILLS, Kentucky, February 25, 2021 LifeSiteNews — Earlier this month, 35 nuns in a northern Kentucky convent received an mRNA-developed COVID-19 vaccine. Just two days later, two died and twenty six others tested positive for the virus. Sister Aileen Bankemper, prioress of the Benedictine Sisters of St. Walburg, noted that the monastery was completely locked down, with no movement of people into or out of the premises for some time prior to having the sisters vaccinated: “We [the Benedictine community] were shocked to have so many [COVID-19] cases since we were being extremely careful, not going out, and not having visitors since the beginning of the pandemic,” Fox19 NOW reported. She even claimed that the sisters “redoubled our efforts after the [Christmas] holiday surge.” Sister Aileen confirmed in a Facebook post, “Twenty-eight sisters tested positive for COVID-19,” following the jab. “The majority of them were able to get the monoclonal antibodies [antibody infusions] through St. Elizabeth’s Senior Services. Their symptoms are being managed pretty well,” she added. Two of their members, however, Sister Charles Wolking and Sister Rita Biltz, quickly deteriorated, dying on February 3, two days after receiving their COVID jabs. Neither had expressed symptoms nor had tested positive for the virus prior to taking the vaccine. Sub-Prioress Sister Nancy Kordenbrok told WKRC that “[b]oth of them were elderly and had some health issues and were not able to compete with COVID.” At the time, a third sister, Margaret Mary Gough, was admitted to ICU at St. Elizabeth Fort Thomas Hospital with respiratory problems after testing positive for COVID-19 following her first dose of the vaccine. Sister Nancy initially expressed hope that Sister Margaret Mary was recovering, saying that she is “[c]urrently in ICU, but we think she will be moved from there. She’s doing so much better. She had serious respiratory issues.” But yesterday, through the monastery’s official Facebook page, she too was confirmed to have died, on February 10, “from complications of the COVID virus.” One other sister recovered in ICU and was able to return to the monastery. In an apparent attempt to quell fears about the dangers of the vaccine, Dr. Steven Feagins, the Hamilton County public health director, explained that strong side-effects are “actually way more common than you might think.” He added that, in cases where the patient suffers side-effects, he recommends simply delaying the second dose: “Whenever you get it, you get it, so we consider the 21 days [between jabs] minimum,” he said. The remaining sisters are set to receive their second dose of the vaccine in May. Since the launch of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System VAERS has recorded a total of 929 deaths from December 15, 2020, up to February 12, 2021, accounting for almost 6% of 15,923 adverse events on the system’s report. 1,869 people were hospitalized, 616 of whom were considered to have suffered a life-threatening reaction. Roughly 66.5 million doses have been administered in the U.S. of either one of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccinations offered by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. Both were given emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration FDA in December, and, until they are fully licenced by the regulator, are considered experimental. — Article continues below Petition — Show Petition Text 0 have signed the petition.

Sign this Petition Hide Petition Text Sign this Petition During LifeSiteNews’ “Unmasking COVID-19” conference, Dr. Sheri Tenpenny, Dr. Eric Nepute and Dr. Pam Popper joined LifeSite’s Stephen Kokx in a panel discussion focused on the science regarding the vaccines, and whether it is right to regard them as the chief protection against COVID-19. The medics decried even calling the injections “vaccines,” since they did not meet the standards necessary for the term, and warned about the risk of the experimental products themselves attacking the body’s immune response system. Tenpenny argued that the currently available vaccines do not merit the name vaccine since they don’t “meet any of the standards by which a vaccine is supposed to work: to prevent the spread of infection, to keep you from getting sick, to keep you from being hospitalized, to decrease the amount of illness, to protect people from this contagion that’s out there. It doesn’t meet any of those standards.” Describing the vaccine manufacturers as having “skipped all the steps” of normal testing and development procedures, Popper noted that “we have no possible hope that this could actually be either safe or effective.” The U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency MHRA, which authorized the use of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford/AstraZeneca developed COVID vaccines for use in Britain, reported that, between December 8 and February 14, it “has received 197 U.K. reports of suspected ADRs to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in which the patient died shortly after vaccination, 205 reports for the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, and 4 where the brand of vaccine was unspecified.” “The majority of these reports were in elderly people or people with underlying illness,” the MHRA added. Italy, too, reported major health concerns regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine after the Tribuna di Treviso newspaper reported “dozens and dozens” of teachers and professors in the Treviso region were too ill to teach on Monday morning, having received the vaccine over the weekend. Consequently, two middle schools had to close during the week due to a lack of staff. Despite the numerous side-effects reported by those who received the vaccine, Michele Mongillo, the director of prevention and public health for the Veneto Region maintained an optimistic position on the effect of AstraZeneca’s abortion-tainted vaccine: “We have begun the vaccination with AstraZeneca this week; there have been a few local reactions, especially fever. Over six thousand doses were given, and a few cases of local reactions were reported to our offices. It’s a temporary phenomenon, and on the bright side it shows that the immune system is reacting to the vaccine.” Meanwhile, in France, the same AstraZeneca vaccine has caused so many adverse side-effects that the French vaccination task force Conseil d’orientation de la stratégie vaccinale has recommended “a staggering of the vaccination schedule for people working in the same care unit” as well as “the systematic intake of paracetamol just before the injection and in the two following days.”",false

He claims he committed 37 assassinations for the American government between 1959 and 1972, including the actress and model, Marilyn Monroe. Hodges says he has no regrets.  In amongst his many confessions, he admits to being a group member of five CIA agents, whose sole task was to carry out assassinations. He also admits one of his assassinations being none other than Glamour icon, Marilyn Monroe, who was killed not just because of her ties with John F Kennedy, but also because she slept with Fidel Castro, ultimately making her a massive national security risk.  Hodges says he has no regrets.  He claims he carried out 37 assassinations for the US Government between 1959 and 1972 including Marilyn Monroe.  Hodges had worked for the CIA.  Hodges was a CIA officer for 41 years working as an operative amongst top level security clearances, he claims he was employed as a hit-man by the organization, his duty was to assassinate individuals who posed a threat to the security of the United States of America.  He was trained as a sniper and a martial arts expert but also trained in other methods ranging from taking people out with poisons to using explosives.  Despite his old age, Hodges has managed to recall each of the assassinations he committed for the CIA. He goes on to admit that the murders were carried out on American soil and by the orders of his then commanding officer, Major James “Jimmy” Hayworth.  He also claims the timeline for the assassinations were between August 1959 and March 1972, when the “the CIA had its own agenda”. Furthermore, he admits that he was part of an operation team of five members, who were taking orders to carry out the assassinations. Their victims were from all walks of life ranging from journalists, union leaders, political activists, artists, and scientists – all of which were killed because their radical ideas posed a threat to the interests of the United States.  Hodges admits that Marilyn Monroe was the only woman he had ever assassinated, a unique target at the time. He claims she had become a significant “threat to the security of the country” and had to be eliminated.  “We had evidence that Marilyn Monroe had not only slept with Kennedy but also with Fidel Castro”, says M. Hodges. “My commanding officer, Jimmy Hayworth, told me that she had to die and that it had to look like a suicide or an overdose. I had never killed a woman before, but I obeyed orders… I did it for America! She could have transmitted strategic information to the communists, and we couldn’t allow that! She had to die! I just did what I had to do!”  Marilyn Monroe died on the 5th of August 1962. Hodges claims he entered her room while the star was sleeping, injecting her with a fatal dose of Chloral Hydrate a very powerful sedative that was also mixed with Nembutal – a short-acting barbiturate, which ultimately caused her death.  The FBI is taking Hodges claims very seriously and has now placed him under custody whilst a full investigation is opened to attempt to verify his allegations.  The most important witness in the case would have been Major James Hayworth, who died of a heart attack in 2011. Two other CIA assassins who were identified by Hodges are also dead.  This could open up many questions about the CIA’s activities in America in that era. What do you think? Why would Hodges say something like this if it weren’t true? Is it all conspiracy garbage?

dca71385,SHOCKING REPORT: Smoking May Protect Lungs From Cancer,"Sharon Stone smoking in Basic Instinct  Every year, thousands of medical doctors and other members of the “Anti-Smoking Inquisition” spend billions of dollars perpetuating what has unquestionably become the most misleading though successful social engineering scam in history. With the encouragement of most western governments, these Orwellian lobbyists pursue smokers with a fanatical zeal that completely overshadows the ridiculous American alcohol prohibition debacle, which started in 1919 and lasted until 1933.  Nowadays we look back on American prohibition with justifiable astonishment. Is it really true that an entire nation allowed itself to be denied a beer or scotch by a tiny group of tambourine-bashing fanatics? Sadly, yes it is, despite a total lack of evidence that alcohol causes any harm to humans, unless consumed in truly astronomical quantities.  Although there is no direct link between alcohol and tobacco, the history of American prohibition is important, because it helps us understand how a tiny number of zealots managed to control the behavior and lives of tens of millions of people. Nowadays exactly the same thing is happening to smokers at the hands of government zealots and ignorant medical practitioners.  Certain governments know that their past actions are directly responsible for causing most of the lung and skin cancers in the world today, so they go to extreme lengths in trying to deflect responsibility and thus financial liability away from themselves, and onto harmless organic tobacco instead. As we will find later in the report, humble organic tobacco has never hurt anyone, and in certain ways can justifiably claim to provide startling health protection.  Not all governments around the world share the same problem. Japan and Greece have the highest numbers of adult cigarette smokers in the world, but the lowest incidence of lung cancer. In direct contrast to this, America, Australia, Russia, and some South Pacific island groups have the lowest numbers of adult cigarette smokers in the world, but the highest incidence of lung cancer. This is clue number-one in unraveling the absurd but entrenched western medical lie that “smoking causes lung cancer.”  The first European contact with tobacco was in 1492, when Columbus and fellow explorer Rodriguo de Jerez saw natives smoking in Cuba. That very same day, de Jerez took his first puff and found it very relaxing, just as the locals had assured him it would be. This was an important occasion, because Rodriguo de Jerez discovered what the Cubans and native Americans had known for many centuries: that cigar and cigarette smoking is not only relaxing, it also cures coughs and other minor ailments. When he returned home, Rodriguo de Jerez proudly lit a cigar in the street, and was promptly arrested and imprisoned for three years by the horrified Spanish Inquisition. De Jerez thus became the first victim of the anti-smoking lobbies.  In less than a century, smoking became a much enjoyed and accepted social habit throughout Europe, with thousands of tons of tobacco being imported from the colonies to meet the increasing demand. A growing number of writers praised tobacco as a universal remedy for mankind’s ills. By the early 20th Century almost one in every two people smoked, but the incidence of lung cancer remained so low that it was almost immeasurable. Then something extraordinary happened on July 16, 1945: a terrifying cataclysmic event that would eventually cause western governments to distort the perception of smoking forever. As K. Greisen recalls:  “When the intensity of the light had diminished, I put away the glass and looked toward the tower directly. At about this time I noticed a blue color surrounding the smoke cloud. Then someone shouted that we should observe the shock wave travelling along the ground. The appearance of this was a brightly lighted circular area, near the ground, slowly spreading out towards us. The color was yellow.”  “The permanence of the smoke cloud was one thing that surprised me. After the first rapid explosion, the lower part of the cloud seemed to assume a fixed shape and to remain hanging motionless in the air. The upper part meanwhile continued to rise, so that after a few minutes it was at least five miles high. It slowly assumed a zigzag shape because of the changing wind velocity at different altitudes. The smoke had pierced a cloud early in its ascent, and seemed to be completely unaffected by the cloud.”  This was the notorious “Trinity Test”, the first dirty nuclear weapon to be detonated in the atmosphere. A six-kilogram sphere of plutonium, compressed to supercriticality by explosive lenses, Trinity exploded over New Mexico with a force equal to approximately 20,000 tons of TNT. Within seconds, billions of deadly radioactive particles were sucked into the atmosphere to an altitude of six miles, where high-speed jet streams could circulate them far and wide.  The American Government knew about the radiation in advance, was well aware of its lethal effects on humans, but bluntly ordered the test with a complete disregard for health and welfare. In law, this was culpable gross negligence, but the American Government did not care. Sooner or later, one way or the other, they would find another culprit for any long-term effects suffered by Americans and other citizens in local and more remote areas.  If a single microscopic radioactive fallout particle lands on your skin at the beach, you get skin cancer. Inhale a single particle of the same lethal muck, and death from lung cancer becomes inevitable, unless you happen to be an exceptionally lucky cigarette smoker. The solid microscopic radioactive particle buries itself deep in the lung tissue, completely overwhelms the body’s limited reserves of vitamin B17, and causes rampant uncontrollable cell multiplication.  How can we be absolutely sure that radioactive fallout particles really cause lung cancer every time a subject is internally exposed? For real scientists, as opposed to medical quacks and government propagandists, this is not a problem. For any theory to be accepted scientifically, it must first be proven in accordance with rigorous requirements universally agreed by scientists. First the suspect radioactive agent must be isolated, then used in properly controlled laboratory experiments to produce the claimed result, i.e. lung cancer in mammals.  Scientists have ruthlessly sacrificed tens of thousands of mice and rats in this way over the years, deliberately subjecting their lungs to radioactive matter. The documented scientific results of these various experiments are identical. Every mouse or rat obediently contracts lung cancer, and every mouse or rat then dies. Theory has thus been converted to hard scientific fact under tightly controlled laboratory conditions. The suspect agent [radioactive matter] caused the claimed result [lung cancer] when inhaled by mammals.  The overall magnitude of lung cancer risk to humans from atmospheric radioactive fallout cannot be overstated. Before Russia, Britain and America outlawed atmospheric testing on August 5, 1963, more than 4,200 kilograms of plutonium had been discharged into the atmosphere. Because we know that less than one microgram [millionth of a single gram] of inhaled plutonium causes terminal lung cancer in a human, we therefore know that your friendly government has lofted 4,200,000,000 [4.2 Billion] lethal doses into the atmosphere, with particle radioactive half-life a minimum of 50,000 years. Frightening? Unfortunately it gets worse.  The plutonium mentioned above exists in the actual nuclear weapon before detonation, but by far the greatest number of deadly radioactive particles are those derived from common dirt or sand sucked up from the ground, and irradiated while travelling vertically through the weapon’s fireball. These particles form by far the largest part of the “smoke” in any photo of an atmospheric nuclear detonation. In most cases several tons of material are sucked up and permanently irradiated in transit, but let us be incredibly conservative and claim that only 1,000 kilograms of surface material is sucked up by each individual atmospheric nuclear test.  Before being banned by Russia, Britain and America, a total of 711 atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted, thereby creating 711,000 kilograms of deadly microscopic radioactive particles, to which must be added the original 4,200 kilograms from the weapons themselves, for a gross though very conservative total of 715,200 kilograms. There are more than a million lethal doses per kilogram, meaning that your governments have contaminated your atmosphere with more than 715,000,000,000 [715 Billion] such doses, enough to cause lung or skin cancer 117 times in every man, woman and child on earth.  Before you ask, no, the radioactive particles do not just “fade away”, at least not in your lifetime or that of your children and grandchildren. With a half-life of 50,000 years or longer, these countless trillions of deadly government-manufactured radioactive particles are essentially with you forever. Circulated around the world by powerful jet streams, these particles are deposited at random, though in higher concentrations within a couple of thousand miles of the original test sites. A simple wind or other surface disturbance is all that is needed to stir them up again and create enhanced dangers for those in the vicinity.  The once-innocent activity of playfully kicking sand around on the beach in summer could nowadays easily translate to suicide, if you happen to stir up a few radioactive particles that could stick to your skin or be inhaled into your lungs.  Twelve years after the cataclysmic Trinity test, it became obvious to western governments that things were getting completely out of control, with a 1957 British Medical Research Council report stating that global “deaths from lung cancer have more than doubled during the period 1945 to 1955”, though no explanation was offered. During the same ten-year period, cancer deaths in the immediate proximity of Hiroshima and Nagasaki went up threefold. By the end of official atmospheric testing in 1963, the incidence of lung cancer in the Pacific Islands had increased fivefold since 1945. Having screwed your environment completely for 50,000 years, it was time for “big government” to start taking heavy diversionary action.  How could people be proved to be causing themselves to contract lung cancer, i.e. be said to be guilty of a self inflicted injury for which government could never be blamed or sued? The only obvious substance that people inhaled into their lungs, apart from air, was tobacco smoke, so the government boot was put in. Poorly qualified medical “researchers” suddenly found themselves overwhelmed with massive government grants all aimed at achieving the same end-result: “Prove that smoking causes lung cancer”. Real scientists especially some notable nuclear physicists smiled grimly at the early pathetic efforts of the fledgling anti-smoking lobby, and lured them into the deadliest trap of all. The quasi-medical researchers were invited to prove their false claims under exactly the same rigid scientific rules that were used when proving that radioactive particles cause lung cancer in mammals.  Remember, for any theory to be accepted scientifically, it must first be proven in accordance with rigorous requirements universally agreed by scientists. First the suspect agent tobacco smoke must be isolated, then used in properly controlled laboratory experiments to produce the claimed result, i.e. lung cancer in mammals. Despite exposing literally tens of thousands of especially vulnerable mice and rats to the equivalent of 200 cigarettes per day for years on end, “medical science” has never once managed to induce lung cancer in any mouse or rat. Yes, you did read that correctly. For more than forty years, hundreds of thousands of medical doctors have been deliberately lying to you.  The real scientists had the quasi-medical researchers by the throat, because “pairing” the deadly radioactive particle experiment with the benign tobacco smoke experiment, proved conclusively for all time that smoking cannot under any circumstances cause lung cancer. And further, in one large “accidental” experiment they were never allowed to publish, the real scientists proved with startling clarity that smoking actually helps to protect against lung cancer.  All mice and rats are used one-time-only in a specific experiment, and then destroyed. In this way researchers ensure that the results of whatever substance they are testing cannot be accidentally “contaminated” by the real or imagined effects of another substance. Then one day as if by magic, a few thousand mice from the smoking experiment “accidentally” found their way into the radioactive particle experiment, which in the past had killed every single one of its unfortunate test subjects. But this time, completely against the odds, sixty percent of the smoking mice survived exposure to the radioactive particles. The only variable was their prior exposure to copious quantities of tobacco smoke.  Government pressure was immediately brought to bear and the facts suppressed, but this did not completely silence the real scientists. Tongue-in-cheek perhaps, Professor Schrauzer, President of the International Association of Bio-inorganic Chemists, testified before a U.S. congressional committee in 1982 that it had long been well known to scientists that certain constituents of tobacco smoke act as anti-carcinogens anti-cancer agents in test animals. He continued that when known carcinogens cancer-causing substances are applied to the animals, the application of constituents of cigarette smoke counter them.  Nor did Professor Schrauzer stop there. He further testified on oath to the committee that “no ingredient of cigarette smoke has been shown to cause human lung cancer”, adding that “no-one has been able to produce lung cancer in laboratory animals from smoking.” It was a neat answer to a rather perplexing problem. If government blocks publication of your scientific paper, take the alternate route and put the essential facts on the written congressional record!  Predictably, this hard truth drove the government and quasi-medical “researchers” into a frenzy of rage. By 1982 they had actually started to believe their own ridiculous propaganda, and were not to be silenced by eminent members of the scientific establishment. Quite suddenly they switched the blame to other “secret” ingredients put into cigarettes by the tobacco companies. “Yes, that must be it!” they clamored eagerly, until a handful of scientists got on the phone and pointed out that these same “secret” ingredients had been included in the mice experiments, and had therefore also been proved incapable of causing lung cancer.  Things were looking desperate for government and the medical community overall. Since the anti-smoking funding had started in the early sixties, tens of thousands of medical doctors had passed through medical school, where they had been taught that smoking causes lung cancer. Most believed the lie, but cracks were starting to appear in the paintwork. Even the dullest of straight “C” doctors could not really make the data correlate, and when they queried it were told not to ask stupid questions. “Smoking causes lung cancer” converted to a creed, a quasi-religious belief mechanism where blind faith became a substitute for proof.  On the mortuary slab the lungs of a smoker and non-smoker look an identical pink, and the only way a forensic pathologist can tell you might have been a smoker, is if he finds heavy stains of nicotine on your fingers, a packet of Camels or Marlboro in your coat pocket, or if one of your relatives unwisely admits on the record that you once smoked the demon weed. Even blind faith needs a system of positive reinforcement, which in this case became the advertising agencies and the media. Suddenly the television screens were flooded with images of terribly blackened “smoker’s lungs”, with the accompanying mantra that you will die in horrible agony if you don’t quit now. It was all pathetic rubbish of course.and the only way a forensic pathologist can tell you might have been a smoker, is if he finds heavy stains of nicotine on your fingers, a packet of Camels or Marlboro in your coat pocket, or if one of your relatives unwisely admits on the record that you once smoked the demon weed.  The black lungs? From a coal miner, who throughout his working life breathed in copious quantities of microscopic black coal dust particles. Just like radioactive particles they get caught deep in the tissue of the lungs and stay there forever.  Many people ask exactly how it is that those smoking mice were protected from deadly radioactive particles, and even more are asking why real figures nowadays are showing far more non-smokers dying from lung cancer than smokers. Professor Sterling of the Simon Fraser University in Canada is perhaps closest to the truth, where he uses research papers to reason that smoking promotes the formation of a thin mucous layer in the lungs, “which forms a protective layer stopping any cancer-carrying particles from entering the lung tissue.”  This is probably as close as we can get to the truth at present, and it does make perfect scientific sense. Deadly radioactive particles inhaled by a smoker would initially be trapped by the mucous layer, and then be ejected from the body before they could enter the tissue.  All of this may be a bit depressing for non-smokers, but there are probably one or two things you can do to minimize the risks as far as possible. Rather than shy away from smokers in your local pub or club, get as close as you can and breathe in their expensive second-hand smoke. Go on, don’t be shy, suck in a few giant breaths. Or perhaps you could smoke one cigarette or small cigar after each meal, just three a day to build up a thin boundary mucous layer. If you cannot or will not do either of the above, consider getting a surgical mask!  .",false
301727dc,Vitamin C Protects Against Coronavirus,"26 2 2 Share 0 Share 5 2 0 24K Like  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  OMNS January 26, 2020 The coronavirus pandemic can be dramatically slowed, or stopped, with the immediate widespread use of high doses of vitamin C.  Physicians have demonstrated the powerful antiviral action of vitamin C for decades. There has been a lack of media coverage of this effective and successful approach against viruses in general, and coronavirus in particular.  It is very important to maximize the body’s anti-oxidative capacity and natural immunity to prevent and minimize symptoms when a virus attacks the human body. The host environment is crucial. Preventing is obviously easier than treating severe illness.  But treat serious illness seriously. Do not hesitate to seek medical attention. It is not an either-or choice. Vitamin C can be used right along with medicines when they are indicated.  “I have not seen any flu yet that was not cured or markedly ameliorated by massive doses of vitamin C.” Robert F. Cathcart, MD  The physicians of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service and the International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine urge a nutrient-based method to prevent or minimize symptoms for future viral infection. The following inexpensive supplemental levels are recommended for adults; for children reduce these in proportion to body weight:  Vitamin C: 3,000 milligrams or more daily, in divided doses.  Vitamin D3: 2,000 International Units daily. Start with 5,000 IU/day for two weeks, then reduce to 2,000  Magnesium: 400 mg daily in citrate, malate, chelate, or chloride form  Zinc: 20 mg daily  Selenium: 100 mcg micrograms daily  Vitamin C [1] , Vitamin D [2] , magnesium [3] , zinc [4] , and selenium [5] have been shown to strengthen the immune system against viruses.  The basis for using high doses of vitamin C to prevent and combat virus-caused illness may be traced back to vitamin C’s early success against polio, first reported in the late 1940s. [6] Many people are unaware, even surprised, to learn this. Further clinical evidence built up over the decades, leading to an anti-virus protocol published in 1980. [7]  It is important to remember that preventing and treating respiratory infections with large amounts of vitamin C is well established. Those who believe that vitamin C generally has merit, but massive doses are ineffective or somehow harmful, will do well to read the original papers for themselves. To dismiss the work of these doctors simply because they had success so long ago sidesteps a more important question: Why has the benefit of their clinical experience not been presented to the public by responsible governmental authorities, especially in the face of a viral pandemic?

1e83af88,Current Actual Election Result Update: President Trump Leading In Electoral College With More Paths to Victory Than Biden,"Based on actual results and accounting for states currently not called, still counting, recounting, under investigation or audit, or states with election issues now in the courts, President Trump is winning the 2020 Presidential Election. Per consideration for all the states still in question, President Trump is currently winning the 2020 election. Here is what we already know. A number of states have been called but a number are still in question. Here is a list of those in question. Pennsylvania – although the current counts show Biden leading there is so much corruption in this state that it is likely that this state will never come to a transparent and agreed upon decision on who wins this state. President Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden. The President has a clear path to victory once the illegal votes are addressed. TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO Wisconsin – this state as well now shows Biden in the lead but early in the morning after the election more than 100,000 votes magically appeared in Milwaukee. The current lead for Biden is only 20,000. If these votes or the exception in the numbers in Rock County are addressed, Trump will likely win this state by a large margin. Michigan – this state is as well full of fraud. Lawsuits are in place. In addition there were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well. Georgia – this state too has much fraud. The President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots. Now Biden leads in this state as well. Once the harvested ballots are thrown out, this state will go to Trump as well. Nevada – there is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here as well.

Ms. Valdez, 70, a former Dallas County sheriff, will face off against Gov. Greg Abbott, the Republican incumbent with a $41 million war chest, who is expected to win in November. It has been nearly 30 years since Texas voters elected a Democrat as governor.  “This election is not going to be bought,” Ms. Valdez said. “Everywhere we go there is so much energy and so much enthusiasm, because people are ready for a change.”",partially false
5d7d6af3,Sanctuary Policies Have Led to Thousands of Crimes,"There has been a fiery debate over the past few weeks about illegal aliens and crime, which has intensified with the murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco by a seven-time felon and five-time deportee as the direct result of the city’s sanctuary policy.  What seems to have been overlooked in the back and forth on this is some of the very disturbing, actual data on crimes committed by illegal aliens, which should concern every American—particularly those who live in sanctuary cities like New Orleans or San Francisco that release criminal aliens rather than turning them over to the Department of Homeland Security.  As Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Study outlines, Department of Homeland Security records show that in just one eight-month period in 2014, more than 8,100 deportable aliens were released by sanctuary jurisdictions. Three thousand of them were felons and 62 percent had a prior criminal record. Nineteen hundred were later rearrested a total of 4,300 times on 7,500 different offenses.  Thus, these sanctuary policies directly victimized thousands of the residents of these sanctuary cities who were subjected to assaults, burglaries, sexual assaults, thefts and even murders that would not have occurred except for these sanctuary policies.  But there is more. In 2005, at the request of several members of Congress, the Government Accountability Office prepared two reports on criminal aliens—legal and illegal—in prison for committing crimes in the United States. Those reports are very revealing. For example, the first report GAO-05-337R released on April 7, 2005, found that:  The percentage of federal prisoners who are criminal aliens is about 27 percent;  In 2004, there were 49,000 such prisoners in federal jails;  In 2002, the federal government gave reimbursements to the 50 states under the “State Criminal Alien Assistance Program” SCAAP for incarcerating another 77,000 illegal aliens in state prisons; and  At the local level in 2002, the federal government reimbursed 750 local governments under SCAAP for incarcerating an additional 138,000 criminal illegal aliens, which jumped to 147,000 prisoners in 2003.  It is important to note that these reported numbers “represent only a portion of the total population of criminal aliens who may be incarcerated at the local level,” since the federal government does “not reimburse localities for all criminal aliens” and some states don’t submit requests for reimbursement. So where were all of these criminal aliens from? According to the GAO report, the breakdown was as follows:  Federal prisons: Mexico 63 percent; Colombia 7 percent; the Dominican Republic 7 percent; Jamaica 4 percent; Cuba 3 percent; El Salvador 2 percent; Honduras, Haiti and Guatemala each 1 percent, and the remaining 11 percent from 164 other countries.  State prisons: In the five states Arizona, California, Florida, New York and Texas incarcerating about 80 percent of SCAAP criminal aliens, the prisoners were from Mexico 58 percent; Cuba 5 percent; Dominican Republic 5 percent; El Salvador 4 percent; Jamaica 3 percent; Vietnam 2 percent; and the remaining 22 percent from 148 other countries.  Local jails: In the five local jails with the largest criminal illegal alien populations, the prisoners were from Mexico 65 percent; El Salvador 6 percent; Guatemala 3 percent; Honduras 2 percent; South Korea, Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines each 1 percent; and the remaining 20 percent from 193 other countries.  Thus, it is clear that criminal aliens already represent more than a quarter of all of the prisoners in federal prisons and are present in large numbers in state and local jails.  The second GAO report GAO-05-646R, released on May 9, 2005, looked at the crimes committed by 55,322 aliens who “had entered the country illegally and were still illegally in the country at the time of their incarceration in federal or state prison or local jail during fiscal year 2003.”  The path of destruction weaved by these 55,322 illegal aliens was truly shocking. According to GAO, these criminal aliens:  Were arrested a total of 459,614 times, averaging about eight arrests per illegal alien;  97 percent had more than one arrest, while 26 percent had over 11 arrests;  Committed almost 700,000 criminal offenses, averaging 13 offenses per illegal alien;  10 percent of these illegal aliens were arrested for committing 26 or more offenses;  Out of all of the arrests, 12 percent were for violent crimes such as murder, robbery, assault and sex-related crimes; 15 percent were for burglary, larceny, theft and property damage; 24 percent were for drug offenses; and the remaining offenses were for DUI, fraud, forgery, counterfeiting, weapons, immigration and obstruction of justice; and  80 percent of the arrests occurred in just three states: California, Texas, and Arizona  Of course, these statistics reflect the criminal histories of aliens who were in prison. Unfortunately, in fiscal year 2013, the Obama administration released over 36,000 convicted criminal aliens awaiting the outcome of deportation hearings upon an unsuspecting public, and another 30,558 in fiscal year 2014 according to the House Judiciary Committee.  The offenses for which they were convicted involved “dangerous drugs, assault and domestic violence, stolen vehicles, robbery, sex offenses, sexual assault, kidnaping, voluntary manslaughter, and even homicide.” As the House Judiciary Committee outlined, more than a quarter of these aliens “were so called ‘level 1s’ according to the administration—the worst of the worst.” And in 2013 alone, the administration didn’t even bring removal proceedings against an additional 68,000 criminal aliens convicted of everything from homicide to sexual assault.  If the over 134,000 aliens released by the administration in just the past two years follow the pattern of those aliens studied by the GAO in 2005, they will commit hundreds of thousands of more crimes, victimizing countless innocent Americans in crimes that could have been prevented.  How many Americans have to be assaulted, injured, raped or killed, or have their homes, cars and personal property burglarized, stolen or damaged before both the federal government and local governments like San Francisco will finally do what is necessary to lock up criminal aliens who are a danger to the safety and lives of the public?",partially false
42ca71d1,BOMBSHELL: Interview Surfaces Of Kamala Harris Saying She Believes Biden’s Accusers [Opinion],"OPINION | This article contains political commentary which reflects the author's opinion.  Correction Notice: This article previously stated that Kamala Harris said she believes Biden’s “rape accusers.” Following a fact-check from LeadStories as well as a correction in The Federalist, there is a distinction drawn between accusations of “sexual assault” and “rape” compared to accusations of “unwanted touching.” We have issued a correction notice to clarify this issue and we regret this mistake.  According to The Hill as well as The Federalist and several other outlets, Kamala Harris said last year that she believes the women who accused Biden of unwanted touching that made them feel uncomfortable.  “I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it,” Harris said in 2019.  Several women have accused Biden of unwanted touching, which includes Amy Lappos, Caitlyn Caruso, D. J. Hill, and former Democratic state lawmaker Lucy Flores.  Flores wrote a story in “The Cut” about how Biden put his hands on her shoulders, smelled her hair from behind, and “proceeded to plant a big slow kiss on the back of my head.”  Harris has been criticized as a hypocrite for supporting Biden over Reade, given her past criticisms of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.  From The Hill:  The California senator added that Biden will need to decide for himself whether to run for president. “He’s going to have to make that decision for himself. I wouldn’t tell him what to do,” Harris said. In recent days, several women have come forward to allege that Biden has touched them inappropriately. Former Nevada state lawmaker Lucy Flores, a Democrat, made the first accusation last week in an essay in New York magazine’s The Cut. On Monday, Amy Lappos told the Hartford Courant that Biden also touched her inappropriately at a 2009 fundraiser in Connecticut. Two additional women, Caitlyn Caruso and D. J. Hill, came forward Tuesday, sharing their experiences with The New York Times. — Advertisement — Biden, who is considering running for president and has led a number of polls of Democrats, has not commented publicly on the accusations since Sunday, when in response to Flores’s allegation he said in a statement that he has “offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support and comfort.” “And not once — never — did I believe I acted inappropriately,” Biden added. “If it is suggested I did so, I will listen respectfully.”  Lappos alleged that Biden “put his hand around my neck and pulled me in to rub noses with me…I thought he was going to kiss me on the mouth.”  Caruso added that Biden put his hand on her thigh and hugged her “just a bit too long.”  The Hill reported that Biden moved his hand down Caruso’s back during a photo op.  Tara Reade also made headlines for accusing Biden of sexually assaulting her while she worked in his U.S. Senate office in 1993.",false
ab9e3c02,Heads Roll at Fox News: Judge Jeanine Show Cancelled,"According to a report by Newsmax, the Fox News Channel has cancelled Judge Jeanine Pirro’s show. The decision came after the network learned that the host planned to cover issues related to suspected fraud in the 2020 election.  On Saturday, Newsmax reported that Fox News canceled Judge Jeanine Pirro’s program after the network learned that she planned to cover issues related to election fraud in the 2020 race for the White House.https://t.co/9cGpA2SyCg — Larry Sanger @lsanger November 8, 2020  More from Objectivist  Rob Schmitt of Newsmax said on air, “Sources close to the network tell us us that’s because she made a very staunch defense of President Trump and wanted to expose or attempt to expose the voter fraud that the Trump campaign and Republicans allege took place.”  Breitbart pointed out that Fox News has been losing viewers since the network appeared to take a leftward turn–especially over the last few weeks. Viewers were especially angry after the network called Arizona for Biden long before all of the votes in that state were cast.  From Breitbart:  The backlash had been brewing for a while but really took off after Chris Wallace’s dreadful and dreadfully biased and dishonest role as moderator in the first presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden.  The backlash then went nuclear after Fox News maliciously and erroneously called Arizona for Joe Biden on Tuesday night — a state that is still too close to call. Fox News has stunk for years, but over the past few months it’s gone beyond stinking to out-and-out betrayal of its loyal viewers, especially with its presidential polls that are not simply incorrect, they are bald-faced lies.  It is unclear where Judge Jeanine will end up now that her show is cancelled. Many former Fox hosts are moving to Newsmax and One America News Network.",false
a7dced63,Facebook Fact Checkers,"The message below was sent to me by a friend who is a former Facebook Fact Checker.  I can't say this on Facebook, but I feel it's important to say. I was a Facebook Fact Checker. And your conspiracy theories about Facebook, are more true than you realize.  I worked for a company named Appen. We are a 3rd party freelance contract company. A few years ago Facebook approached us with an offer. Zuckerburg couldn't legally censor people on his platform because he told congress that he was an open forum. So, he uses several 3rd party companies to Fact Check, and otherwise censor, information.  Justin Trudeau has been taking action in Canada, China, and America, to prepare us for the Great Reset, and by us, I refer to civilians. Part of this process is to work with Zuckerburg and Dorsey to restrict the flow of information, and to push the statutes of the Reset into peoples minds: repetition is the key here.  We coordinate our efforts with a company in India, from our base in Canada, to provide our censorship services to Facebook. A lot of this information, you probably already guessed. But here's what you might not have known  We have specific directives on what to fact check and how to fact check. I'm going to list off a couple of these directives:  1 First off, primarily conservative and right leaning posts on Twitter and Facebook make it to our service.  2 Left leaning posts are to be ignored and never manually flagged, it doesn’t matter if it violates TOS or even federal law. If Facebook gets in trouble they blame us, and they can't do anything because we're not based in America, so we give the government the run around and nothing can be done. It's worked so far.  3 Zuckerburg created a program that feeds posts automatically into our service, it analyzes content in posts, searching for common images and lines of text, and if it matches any of our guidelines it gets automatically flagged and entered into our system to be Fact Checked. So we don't just go looking for conservative posts, Zuckerburg sends them to us with his automatic program.  4If there are multiple ideas in a conservative post, only 1 of them needs to be potentially disputable. We are to flag an entire article as disputed/false/discredited/untrue/etc even if theres only 1 idea thats not completely confirmed.  5 Even ideas that are confirmed, don't matter unless its a left leaning idea. What this translates to is as long as we all push the same idea, what we say becomes truth. That's standard psychology, and American's are the easiest to manipulate with this. The only thing making it difficult is their Freedoms that are not common in most countries around the world, which forces us to deal with America in a different way.  6When we write articles for Politico, NYT, etc we are allowed to mark a title or article as true as long as at least 3 of the core ideas in the article or post are potentially true. Keyword here is potentially, it can be completely false, but as long as we can cite a source that argues in our favor, we can confirm it 100% true. The inverse is also true, if we can find even 1 source that dictates something to be potentially false, we can mark the entire article/post.  7 We write articles, and then cite our own articles as evidence. Check the fine print of each article, we always cite ourselves, but what you might not know, is that only a handful of companies are actually writing the articles for dozens of websites, news media, and mass media. This isn't unique to America, we've done this in countries around the world for a very long time.  8  We only allow members to join us if they pass a test, this test is an opinion based survey, however, they must answer all left leaning, or they are not allowed to join, we wont be diluted.  9 This part I cannot confirm, but I am suspicious that China has more to do with this than just their involvement with Canada, but again, I can't confirm that, thats just my personal theory because we're not allowed to say anything negative in our business chats about China's government.  10 This is all preparation for the Great Reset, by getting Trump out, because he opposed the idea. Biden has agreed to go full on into it, which is why he's been getting such a big hand from Facebook and Twitter, however, it's much bigger than just that. In our new world order, we'll control not just national news, but global news. By controlling the global narrative, we control what information you're allowed to know and what you're allowed to think.  11 There are contingencies in place, Trump cannot win. We have members of Congress who are part of this, and soon the President and VP.  12 If a Civil War breaks out, it will be according to our plan. We hope for it, and we tried to use Race to spark it in America, if that doesn’t work, ISIS is on stand by for when Biden is in office. This was determined along time ago, or so i'm told.  13 I no longer work for this company. I registered with them using a fake identity.  #Greatreset #covid",false
ecc6b873,"CDC Exposed: Inflated Covid Deaths By 1600% Throughout The Election, “Violated Multiple Federal Laws” Peer-Reviewed Study Finds...State, Local Governments Must Act","Throughout the election, Donald Trump was battered by CCP Virus statistics in order to hurt the American economy and his political campaign. We know that it was shamelessly wielded as a political weapon to prevent President Trump and his supporters from rallying as Antifa and Black Lives Matter burned progressive poor and minority neighborhoods to the ground throughout the entire year. Now that Biden has been installed into the office of president, he promises to increase Covid lockdown measures and extend them further into your ability to travel and force unscientific mask-wearing for at least 100 days. But, a new peer reviewed study has been released that finds the CDC numbers to be so wildly unsupported as to be pure propaganda that is based on wholly unscientific practices that were needlessly created on-the-spot. The National File Reports “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC stands accused of violating federal law by inflating Coronavirus fatality numbers, according to stunning information obtained by NATIONAL FILE. CDC illegally inflated the COVID fatality number by at least 1,600 percent as the 2020 presidential election played out, according to a study published by the Public Health Initiative of the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge. The study, “COVID-19 Data Collection, Comorbidity & Federal Law: A Historical Retrospective,” was authored by Henry Ealy, Michael McEvoy, Daniel Chong, John Nowicki , Monica Sava, Sandeep Gupta, David White, James Jordan , Daniel Simon, and Paul Anderson.” The study is 25 pages long with over 100 citations. However, the main main points can be summarized. A major point is that testing inaccuracies and unreliability combined with unscientific procedures and methods resulted in demonstrably massive false-positive spikes: “The CDC is now legally requiring red-blooded Americans to wear face masks on all public transportation as globalists try to push the concept of “double-masking” on the populace. Since the election, the World Health Organization admits that PCR tests are not totally reliable on the first try and a second test might be needed. This corresponds with CDC’s quiet admission that it blended viral and antibody test results for its case numbers and that people can test positive on an antibody test if they have antibodies from a family of viruses that cause the common cold. Hospitals in Florida had so many accuracy complications that Orlando Health had to admit that its 9.4 percent positivity rate got recorded at 98 percent. READ: The TRUTH About Fauci and Gates And NIH Owning A Stake in the Vaccine.” There are also profound legal implications raised by the study that need to be dealt with in courts around the country if America is to ever be free again. The data you have been spoonfed by the CDC for a year raises serious legal issues. Much like the 2020 election, massive changes in rules for reporting and collecting data were instituted exclusively for Covid which resulted in a 1600% inflated number of fatalities: “The groundbreaking peer-reviewed research…asserts that the CDC willfully violated multiple federal laws including the Information Quality Act, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Administrative Procedures Act at minimum. Publishing Journal – Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge / Public Health Policy Initiative Most notably, the CDC illegally enacted new rules for data collection and reporting exclusively for COVID-19 that resulted in a 1,600% inflation of current COVID-19 fatality totals,” the watchdog group All Concerned Citizens declared in a statement provided to NATIONAL FILE, referring to the Institute for Pure and Applied Knowledge study. “The research demonstrates that the CDC failed to apply for mandatory federal oversight and failed to open a mandatory period for public scientific comment in both instances as is required by federal law before enacting new rules for data collection and reporting. The CDC is required to be in full compliance with all federal laws even during emergency situations. The research asserts that CDC willfully compromised the accuracy and integrity of all COVID-19 case and fatality data from the onset of this crisis in order to fraudulently inflate case and fatality data,” stated All Concerned Citizens.” But that is not all. Other major Covid collection and reporting standards created on March 24th of 2020 that inexplicably and intentionally changed decades old practices in order to hide comorbidities and preexisting health conditions on death reports. These underlying health conditions may likely have been the actual or most important cause of death: “On March 24th the CDC published the NVSS COVID-19 Alert No. 2 document instructing medical examiners, coroners and physicians to deemphasize underlying causes of death, also referred to as pre-existing conditions or comorbidities, by recording them in Part II rather than Part I of death certificates as “…the underlying cause of death are expected to result in COVID-19 being the underlying cause of death more often than not.” This was a major rule change for death certificate reporting from the CDC’s 2003 Coroners’ Handbook on Death Registration and Fetal Death Reporting and Physicians’ Handbook on Medical Certification of Death, which have instructed death reporting professionals nationwide to report underlying conditions in Part I for the previous 17 years. This single change resulted in a significant inflation of COVID-19 fatalities by instructing that COVID-19 be listed in Part I of death certificates as a definitive cause of death regardless of confirmatory evidence, rather than listed in Part II as a contributor to death in the presence of pre-existing conditions, as would have been done using the 2003 guidelines. The research draws attention to this key distinction as it has led to a significant inflation in COVID fatality totals. By the researcher’s estimates, COVID-19 recorded fatalities are inflated nationwide by as much as 1600% above what they would be had the CDC used the 2003 handbooks,” stated All Concerned Citizens. And, still, there is MORE! Last spring the CDC created covid-19-exclusive rules that violated federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development and wrote new rules to count probable cases without any definitive proof of infection. The new rules also allowed tracers to practice medicine without a license while disallowing any measures to be put in place to prevent a patient from being counted multiple times: “Then on April 14th, the CDC adopted additional rules exclusive for COVID-19 in violation of federal law by outsourcing data collection rule development to the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists CSTE, a non-profit entity, again without applying for oversight and opening opportunity for public scientific review. On April 5th the CSTE published a position paper Standardized surveillance case definition and national notification for 2019 novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 listing 5 CDC employees as subject matter experts. This key document created new rules for counting probable cases as actual cases without definitive proof of infection section VII.A1 – pages 4 & 5, new rules for contact tracing allowing contact tracers to practice medicine without a license section VII.A3 – page 5, and yet refused to define new rules for ensuring that the same person could not be counted multiple times as a new case section VII.B – page 7,” stated All Concerned Citizens. Why would those in power wish to do such inhumane things to the entire population of America? The National File concludes: “By enacting these new rules exclusively for COVID-19 in violation of federal law, the research alleges that the CDC significantly inflated data that has been used by elected officials and public health officials, in conjunction with unproven projection models from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation IHME, to justify extended closures for schools, places of worship, entertainment, and small businesses leading to unprecedented emotional and economic hardships nationwide. A formal petition has been sent to the Department of Justice as well as all US Attorneys seeking an immediate grand jury investigation into these allegations,” All Concerned Citizens stated.” There is much more to the report, and we suggest that you read it at the link provided in the beginning of this article. All data since last year suggest that Covid-19 hysteria is part of an orchestrated coup against Western values, nations, and laws. At what point will the evidence and data be enough to break the spell cast on millions of Americans by the Covid Cult? Please, bring this report to your local officials and insist that they read it and reverse the policies being implemented and ramped up across the country or America is surely dead.",false

01ed1b22,"Before This Election, Newt Gingrich Believed the Popular Vote Winner Should Be President – Mother Jones","Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.      Newt Gingrich, one of Donald Trump’s top surrogates and a possible Cabinet pick for the Republican president-elect, does not believe that Trump, who lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton, won the presidency within a fully fair and representative electoral system.  That is, if Gingrich’s words from two years ago can be taken seriously.  As has been widely noted on the internet, Trump four years ago questioned the legitimacy of the Electoral College system, which selects presidents based on the states they win rather than the total votes they receive. On Election Day 2012, when there was public speculation that Mitt Romney might win the popular vote but lose in the Electoral College to President Barack Obama, Trump went on a tweet storm, calling the election “a total sham and a travesty.” He exclaimed, “We are not a democracy.” He called for “revolution” against this “great and disgusting injustice” and slammed the “phoney electoral college.” In April, Ben Carson also questioned the need for the Electoral College.  Now add Gingrich to the list of Trumpsters who question the legitimacy of the system that handed Trump the presidency.  In 2014, Gingrich sent a letter to National Popular Vote, a nonpartisan group that promotes legislation that would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes nationally. According to its website, 11 states have passed legislation that would hand their electoral votes to the popular-vote winner if enough states do the same. The measure has been approved in one chamber in an additional 12 states. The organizers of this initiative advocate the reform mainly because the current system compels candidates to devote time and resources only to swing states, meaning that Americans in other states and their specific issues are largely ignored. This campaign has not received tremendous attention, but two years ago Gingrich jumped on board.  In his letter to the organization, Gingrich endorsed its proposal. He wrote, “This important project has the potential to transform the way we elect our presidents and to make sure all Americans have a voice in their future.” Gingrich explained:  We are a country of 314 million people, the most diverse nation on Earth. This is one of our greatest strengths, and it means our president must be the president of an enormously complex and varied country…Unfortunately, the current system for electing presidents does not reflect this tremendous diversity. The winner-take-all-method of allotting electoral votes means candidates must focus their efforts on just a handful of closely divided states.  Gingrich added, “America would be better served with a presidential election process that treated citizens across the country equally.” Picking a president by the national popular vote, he asserted, would be in sync with “fundamental democratic principles.”  That was then. This is now. The most current vote counts show Clinton leading Trump, 60 million votes to 59.8 million votes, a spread of one-fifth of a percentage point. That means more Americans wanted her to be president. But don’t expect Gingrich—or Trump—to question the fairness of a process that is now putting one of the most divisive major-party candidates into the White House. All their previous talk about fairness and the popular vote is no longer operative. But Trump’s 2012 observation still stands: The United States may be a republic, but, in pure terms, it is not a democracy.",true
afd9da6e,BOMBSHELL: WHO Coronavirus PCR Test Primer Sequence is Found in All Human DNA,"This was important enough that I wanted to get it out immediately. My research into the NCBI database for nucleotide sequences has lead to a stunning discovery. One of the WHO primer sequences in the PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is found in all human DNA!  The sequence “CTCCCTTTGTTGTGTTGT” is an 18-character primer sequence found in the WHO coronavirus PCR testing protocol document. The primer sequences are what get amplified by the PCR process in order to be detected and designated a “positive” test result. It just so happens this exact same 18-character sequence, verbatim, is also found on Homo sapiens chromosome 8! As far as I can tell, this means that the WHO test kits should find a positive result in all humans. Can anyone explain this otherwise?  I really cannot overstate the significance of this finding. At minimum, it should have a notable impact on test results.

If it weren’t for them, we would not have the freedom to complain about what they do.”  The 66-year-old Washington, who won an Academy Award for best supporting actor in the 1989 Civil War drama “Glory” about one of the first Union Black infantry units and a best actor award for playing a corrupt detective in the 2001 crime thriller “Training Day,” said he traced his respect for police while researching a role for the 1991 film “Ricochet.”  Having played many roles as police officers and soldiers throughout his career, Washington recalled answering a call with a sergeant to a distraught man outside his house with rifle.  “I wasn’t getting out. He got out,” Washington said. “As he got out, another car came screaming up and two young people jumped out screaming. As it turned out, it was their grandfather. This policeman defused the entire situation by just remaining calm.  “But it showed me in an instant how they can lose their life. … He didn’t overreact. He could’ve pulled his gun out and shot the people that came up driving real fast. He could’ve shot the old man that was distraught and a bit confused, I think he was suffering a little bit from dementia. But in an instant, it taught me, and I never forgot it, what our law enforcement people have to deal with moment to moment, second to second.”  Washington gave the interview as his latest film, “The Little Things,” where he plays a law enforcement officer for the 13th time beside Rami Malek, opened Friday in theaters.",false

34b5c124,L.A. Times Op-ed: California Bear Flag is a Symbol of American Oppression,"The California flag, beloved by millions, proudly adorning t-shirts up and down the coast and hung on the dorm room walls of homesick Californian students nationwide, has to go.  That’s the message of a Los Angeles Times op-ed by writer Alex Abella, who calls the Bear Flag “a symbol of blatant illegality and racial prejudice,” hoisted by a rebel band of “slave owners, murderers, thieves, drunks and squatters.” Abella does not suggest an alternative with which the flag should be replaced.  In Abella’s retelling of the story, California under Mexican rule was a relative paradise, with “a democratic government, paternalistic and often beset by political conflicts, yet multi-ethnic and racially integrated.” The new American regime “denied civil rights to blacks and Indians,” and set about exterminating the state’s indigenous population, stealing land and livestock, imposing an alien system of laws rather than the existing system set up under the Spanish-speaking Californios.  Most Californians have a different view. The liberal public radio station KPCC posted a story in 2012 about the origins of the bear on the flag, with the introduction: “We might be biased–but California has one of the best state flags, no? The bold star on the left, the green patch of land… and–of course–the California grizzly bear, our state animal, forever trudging along.”  According to snopes.com, the inclusion of a bear in the flag was a mistake; it was supposed to be a pear.  Update: Snopes.com indicates that its own story about the pear is not true.

Kamala Harris of California was caught in a major lie Wednesday night at the 2020 vice presidential debate, directly contradicting a history of promises from her and her running mate to defend against claims a Biden-Harris administration would ban American hydraulic fracturing for oil and natural gas.  The claim came as Harris sparred with incumbent Vice President Mike Pence over how best to address the issue of climate change.  “Joe Biden will not end fracking,” Harris said. “He has been very clear about that.”  Harris would provide no explanation and no qualifiers, her campaign simply going on to suggest the claim was “fact” in a statement published to Twitter moments later.  .@JoeBiden will not ban fracking.

According to the Washington Examiner, Harris herself suggested during a town hall hosted by CNN in the heat of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary last September that she would take action to ban hydraulic fracturing on public lands on “day one” if elected president.  “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking,” Harris told the audience.

ab4c429e,Former President Barack Obama arrested for ESPIONAGE – Conservative Beaver,"Barack Obama, a former President of the US, was arrested on Nov. 28, 2020, on a charge that he conspired with a business partner of his who also was a former CIA officer to communicate classified information up to the Top Secret level to intelligence officials of the People’s Republic of China PRC. The Criminal Complaint containing the charge was unsealed this morning.  Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers, U.S. Attorney for the District of Hawaii Kenji M. Price, Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Alan E. Kohler Jr., and Special Agent in Charge of the FBI’s Honolulu Field Office Eli S. Miranda made the announcement.  The judge has imposed a “media blackout”, but Canadian outlets like Conservative Beaver are not subject to those rules. Other Canadian and Spanish-language outlets have already reported on this development.  “The trail of Chinese espionage is long and, sadly, strewn with former American intelligence officers who betrayed their colleagues, their country and its liberal democratic values to support an authoritarian communist regime,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers. “This betrayal is never worth it. Whether immediately, or many years after they thought they got away with it, we will find these traitors and we will bring them to justice. To the Chinese intelligence services, these individuals are expendable. To us, they are sad but urgent reminders of the need to stay vigilant.”  “The charges announced today are a sobering reminder to our communities in Hawaii of the constant threat posed by those who seek to jeopardize our nation’s security through acts of espionage,” said U.S. Attorney Price. “Of particular concern are the criminal acts of those who served in our nation’s intelligence community, but then choose to betray their former colleagues and the nation-at large by divulging classified national defense information to China.

ca2ff44e,"One in three dementia patients who pay for care have to sell their home, shock new poll reveals","One in three people with dementia who pay for their own care have to sell their home, an exclusive poll reveals today.  Eight in ten people think politicians have failed to tackle the social care crisis, the survey found, and two-thirds believe the current system – which denies funding to anyone who owns a home or has £23,250 in savings – is unfair. Eight in ten also said the NHS should fund dementia support.  The Daily Mail is campaigning for ministers to end the dementia care cost betrayal, with support flooding in from readers, charities, doctors and MPs.  As pressure mounted on politicians to deliver reform:  Experts last night called on Boris Johnson to match Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt’s promise to act;  Former home secretary David Blunkett, writing in today’s newspaper, admitted Labour failed to take action while in power;  Readers continued to write in with heartbreaking stories of the unfair tax on dementia.  Labour MP Clive Betts, chairman of the local government select committee, said: ‘This poll shows how unfair the whole system is.  ‘If you are an older person who has a heart attack, your medical care is paid for.  ‘But if you get dementia, and own your own home and need care, you have to pay for that care yourself and many have to sell their house to do so. It is completely unacceptable and it needs to be brought to an end.’  Experts called on Boris Johnson to match Tory leadership rival Jeremy Hunt’s promise to act  Sally Copley, of the Alzheimer’s Society, which has led support for the Mail’s campaign, said: ‘No-one should be forced to sell a home they have worked their whole lives for just because they develop one health condition and not another. This cruel lottery has to end.  ‘The next prime minister must release plans of how he will find a sustainable funding solution for the social care system in the long term, which doesn’t rely on the houses of people with dementia to pay for it.’  The poll of 1,013 adults, carried out by Survation on behalf of the Mail, lays bare the impact on families.  Some 26 per cent of respondents said a member of their family or a friend had been diagnosed with dementia. Of those, 52 per cent said they had to pay for their care, of which an alarming 31 per cent had to sell their home to do so.  Some 27 per cent said they had spent more than £50,000 on care and 6 per cent said the bill had exceeded an astonishing £100,000. Nearly seven in ten of respondents said they would support cutting foreign aid to better fund social care. A third said they would back a small increase in income tax or national insurance.  Boris Johnson arrives at an address in Westminster  The Mail is calling for the urgent formation of a cross-party group to tackle the funding crisis – tasked with dealing with the issue once and for all.  In the meantime, the Government must set up a ‘dementia fund’ to help families pay the extra cost of supporting those affected. And it must end the ‘double subsidy’ which sees those deemed able to afford to pay for care subsidising the costs of support for those funded by the state.  Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘It’s fantastic to see the Daily Mail taking up the cudgels on behalf of the hundreds of thousands who are losing out massively because of the Government’s failure to act on social care. The current system is not only incredibly stingy, it is grossly underfunded too, so some people are struggling to get even their meagre rights recognised and their needs met.  ‘Our new prime minister should firstly put out the fire which threatens social care today, and then get good people around him to help build something better, fairer and more fire-proof.’  Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We are pleased to see this campaign directly tackling some of the barriers for patients with dementia. We hope it goes some way to finally addressing what has long been an unacceptable situation in England.’  Labour MP Debbie Abrahams, co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on dementia, said: ‘People with dementia are faced with higher costs for their care, costing an average 15 per cent more than if they had standard social care. Social care is in crisis and it leaves people with dementia and their families struggling within a broken and unfair system.  ‘The injustice of people battling to get care, on top of battling the devastating effects of dementia can’t go on.’ The Department of Health and Social Care said: ‘People who need social care should not have to pay more than they can reasonably afford and we introduced reforms aimed at preventing people being forced to sell their homes to pay for their own care in their lifetime.  ‘We will set out our plans to reform the system at the earliest opportunity to protect people from high and unpredictable costs.’  'Mum worked all her life. She paid taxes. Then her home was sold to pay for her care – and subsidise those who didn’t save. It’s so very unfair, I despair'  It’s just days since we launched our campaign to reform dementia care and we’ve been inundated with your heart-breaking letters about how you’ve had to sell prized family homes to pay for the care of loved ones, while those who have never saved have had their care paid for by the state. Here are a selection of your anguished accounts — and write to us at dementiacare@dailymail.co.uk to tell us your own story...  When my late mother, Peggy, was diagnosed with dementia, I couldn’t look after her as I already had to care at home for my husband, Jim, who had Alzheimer’s.  Sadly, she had to go into residential care, selling her lovely home in the Cotswolds in 2005 for £176,000 to pay for the costs.  After nine years in a home, all that money, as well as her pension, was eventually spent on her care — a total of approximately £220,000.  She died in 2015, having used up her entire savings on helping subsidise others funded by the local authority at reduced rates.  Penalised: Ann Reid centre with her mother Peggy left and father Bryan  Pictured: Ann Reid's parents in happier days  It is clear to everyone who has watched a loved-one battle with dementia that there simply isn’t enough money being spent on funding care.  It’s completely unfair that people can work hard all their lives and save up for a home — often by not going on holidays — and be penalised for it if they are diagnosed with dementia.  Paying thousands every year isn’t even a guarantee of good care. In 2008, I remember going to visit my mother and found a nasty note left by a nurse, telling her not to bang on the table.  I was absolutely disgusted, and there’s no sign that our care system is improving.  The only way we are going to fix the dementia care crisis is if our Government puts it at the top of its agenda.  Ever since my mother was diagnosed, politicians have made countless promises about how things are going to get better. But time after time, their words have proved meaningless.  One can only despair.  ANN REID, Eastbourne, East Sussex.  AFTER A LIFE OF HARD WORK  When my mother was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2015, she was initially cared for by her husband, my stepfather.  But after he died a year later, her dementia became worse and we had to move her into residential care. To fund the £986 per week costs, we had to sell Mum’s bungalow — and spend all of her savings. To this day, we have spent £118,800 on Mum’s care.  She worked hard throughout her life. Why was she left to fend for herself after a life-time of paying taxes and National Insurance?  SUE MORRISSEY, Brighton, East Sussex.  The Mail’s articles and letters about those suffering have brought back painful memories of my mother and my mother-in-law, who were both diagnosed with this dreadful illness. Successive governments have — and are still — shirking their responsibilities to solve the current crisis. There are those who say the current situation is a time-bomb.  But that bomb has already exploded and nothing is being done to clear up the mess.  TREVOR HAYES, Knaresborough, N. Yorks.  I feel ashamed  My wife has vascular dementia and to get help we have suffered the insult of the local council carrying out a means-test on our finances.  I left school at 15 and started work, before being called up to do National Service aged 18. Afterwards, I worked all my life, paying every due required.  I finally saved enough to buy my house, only for it to be taken from me to fund my wife’s care. Meanwhile, those who saved nothing get financial assistance. I am now 83 and feel ashamed with the way we are being treated — especially since I’ve spent my life helping make this country the place it is.  A. ROBERTS, Chelmsford, Essex.  Selling mum's home  My mother was diagnosed with vascular dementia about four years ago.  For the next two years, my sister and I tried to support her at home but after she nearly burnt the house down we decided she was safer in a residential home.  Now, after paying £80,000 in costs, we have had to sell the family home to fund her care.  Our parents worked hard all of their lives, saving and investing, believing they were leaving a legacy to their children.  Instead their money is being used to subsidise other people’s treatment.  LES HITCH, Ware, Hertfordshire.  Our vanishing savings  My husband was diagnosed with vascular dementia in 2010. I managed to look after him until my own health deteriorated, when our family persuaded me to put him into care.  He is now 92 and remarkably fit. He no longer recognises me but appears to be contented.  Meanwhile, his £957 per week costs mean our savings are rapidly vanishing.  RHODA MILLAR, Leamington Spa, Warks.  My uncle Felix spent the last two years of his life suffering from dementia in a nursing home in Newry, Northern Ireland. He had worked all his life as a farmer, remained a bachelor and had hoped to pass on his four farms to his brother and sister.  But in 2017, his health deteriorated and he had to go into residential care. To pay for his care, his house and farms were rented out.  By the time he passed away after 17 months in May 2018, we had spent over £50,000 on his care.  PATRICIA O’HARE, Northern Ireland.  And you also expressed your fury...  Almost every family will, at some time, have someone suffering from dementia. Why can’t we maintain just half the foreign aid budget and plough the rest into dementia research?  D. Marks, Featherstone, W. Yorks.  A CARE FUND NEEDED  Everyone earning over a certain amount should have to pay in to a designated dementia care fund, with graduated payments based on their level of income.  J. SAYERS, Hastings, East Sussex.  It is about time the Government ring-fenced part of our taxes and spent it solely on dementia care.  MAIR KENNEDY, address supplied  My biggest worry  I am 75. I left school at 15, as many did in the Fifties and Sixties. Since then, I have worked every day in various forms of employment. I finally retired at 70. Now, I worry that everything I have saved could be spent on care.  ALAN HARMER, address supplied.  I left school when I was 16 and joined the Royal Navy, where I served for seven years.  After meeting the girl of my dreams, we got married and bought a house.  I’m now 83, living on my pension after my wife died last year. If I develop dementia, I will have to sell my home to fund my care. Why did I bother to strive all those years? Why did I bother to be self-sufficient?  ALAN JACOBS, Biddenham, Bedfordshire.  Cross the border!  As the Royal Commission’s recommendation for free care was rejected by the Government in 2000 but adopted in Scotland, I suggest we should take people suffering from dementia over the border.  After all, Scotland costs all of us through our taxes for this preferential treatment of their suffering old people.  Susan Middleton, Keighley, West Yorkshire.  The wrong priorities  The dementia care scandal simply shows that the majority of our politicians are happier splashing billions of our cash on foreign aid than looking after our own.  B. EKINS, Chessington, Surrey.  Hospitals treat for free those people who have smoked or consume copious amounts of alcohol. I have done neither. In fact, I have cost the NHS nothing to treat illnesses that could justifiably be regarded as, at least in part, self-inflicted.  But I do have one condition I have been unable to control.  I am ageing.  Should I have the temerity to develop dementia, I shall be judged so responsible for the illness that I shall be expected to fund my own treatment.  How does that make any sort of sense?  SUSAN YOUNG, Coulsdon, Surrey.  What’s terrible is the effect this dementia tax is having on working-class families.  Those who have scrimped and saved on meagre wages to pay off mortgages throughout their lives, but were still lucky enough to have saved something towards their retirement, are having it guzzled up by this utterly unfair system.  J. HAGUE, Wakefield, West Yorkshire.  Isn’t it amazing that the Government can pay for dementia care for people who have never contributed towards the National Health Service, and make the people who have contributed to the system all their working lives pick up the bill?  G. BRENNAN, Birmingham.  Profligate politicians  If we reined in the excesses of and the likes of profligate politicians and the Department for International Development, perhaps we could start to look after our own.  COLIN WILLIAMS, Devon.  As well as sorting out the disparity in what people pay for dementia care, we also need to ask why care homes have become so expensive.  It’s a scandal.  CASPER GORNIOK, Surrey.  It terrified me  I am in my late 60s and the thought of being diagnosed with dementia and losing everything I have worked for fills me with terror.  WILLIAM ROSS, address supplied.  Why should a person who has been frugal be worse off than someone who hasn’t, despite both having paid into the same system?  Dementia care funding is completely unfair and needs a thorough overhaul so that all are treated the same.  KEITH MARTIN,  New Milton, Hampshire  Diagnosed at just 58, I fear I’ll lose all I’ve worked for...  By Wendy Mitchell  Can you imagine being diagnosed with young-onset dementia at the age of 58?  The debilitating mental effects of the disease are well-documented, and the stress of living with it is hard enough for anyone.  But for people with young-onset dementia, you don’t just fear losing your memories. You fear losing your future.  I would know — for five years ago, at just 58, I received my diagnosis.  Now, as my condition accelerates, I fear that the future I had once mapped out for myself is a mere pipe dream.  For years, I was encouraged by successive governments to save my money wisely. I didn’t smoke, didn’t drink, and always counted my pennies when they came.  Despairing: Wendy Mitchell, who worked as an NHS hospital manager, at home in Yorkshire  One day, I was told I would even be a homeowner.  And if I had a bit left over, perhaps I could leave it to my daughters.  But now, thanks to the current dementia care system’s insistence that people like me need to spend almost all our savings on care, I often ask myself: ‘Why did I bother?’  For everything that I worked hard for, including my house, will one day have to pay for care costs; care that’s often inadequate and degrading.  That’s my future... This is my life.  I spent 20 years working as an NHS hospital manager in Yorkshire. But when I’ll need the NHS most, it won’t be there for me.  Only a wealthy minority can afford the luxury of well-staffed, well-supported homes. Even if I sold my house, the sum I would get would only keep me in a good, reputable care home for a while.  Then what? Will I be carted off to a dusty corner somewhere?  When it comes to people with dementia, the Government has made it clear that we are not a priority.  It’s more than happy to cause distress and financial hardship for those caring for loved ones, just to save a few million pounds. Yet the trauma experienced by hard-working families is costing lives.  We have known for decades that our ageing population is constantly increasing. So why have consecutive governments failed to address this social care problem?  If I had been diagnosed with cancer, I would have had an automatic right to free care up until my death.  Why should I be punished financially for having dementia? Why should I have to sell my house to cover care costs, when other conditions are supported? Is dementia really less worthy?  The much-needed Green Paper on social care was finally promised back in April, after a two-year delay. Yet our current Government has delayed it six times. Six!  That review was supposed to bring us hope. But in its place, pain, frustration and financial ruin have run rampant.  This is a disgrace. We should all hang our heads in shame.  Wendy Mitchell is the author of Somebody I Used To Know.  Scandal of my sister embarrasses us all  By Lord Blunkett  David Blunkett's half-sister, Doreen, who had Dementia  Just over ten years ago, I received a note from then Labour Health Secretary Alan Johnson kindly asking if I would attend the launch of his ground-breaking plan to resolve the dementia care crisis.  He knew I was an ardent critic of what was then the care system, which hung dementia patients out to dry, and that I would support his demand for a £150 million pot from the Treasury which could be used to boost dementia services.  It was an admirable demand — one that, in 2009, we felt was long overdue.If you had told me then that our rotting dementia care system would remain untreated, I would have laughed you out of the room.  Even in the late Seventies, when I chaired the social services committee of Sheffield City Council, we were aware our country’s dementia care system was woefully inadequate.  At Johnson’s policy launch, he asked me to speak but, thanks to some mix up, mistakenly introduced me as the vice-president of the Alzheimer’s Society. It turned out to be a fortunate error, however, as afterwards the organisation’s chief executive actually sought me out and offered me the role. I was thrilled.  But Alzheimer’s soon came to play a different role in my life.  For little did I know at the time that my half-sister, Doreen, who died last year, was on the verge of developing dementia. Her diagnosis hammered home the debilitating impact that this disease can have on an individual with it, as well as their family.  Just imagine being told you have dementia, realising why boiling a kettle, or using a cash machine, has been posing a challenge it never did before; why the words that once sprung to mind so easily now suddenly elude you.  Doreen's diagnosis hammered home the debilitating impact that this disease can have on an individual with it, as well as their family pictured: David Blunkett, 2005  Then comes the second, equally frustrating blow: you are told that despite having a life-changing condition — despite the fact that you have paid taxes all your life — the NHS won’t cover your social care.  And so for many families, a diagnosis of dementia is often accompanied by financial punishment.  This is what most terrified Doreen and her husband, Jack, who was physically ill before her condition deteriorated.  Rather than go into residential care, and risk having to spend all their savings and sell their house to pay for it, they coped with care at home for as long as possible.  Eventually, Jack’s deteriorating health meant they could no longer manage, and in 2015 they moved into residential care.  Jack died shortly after, but Doreen spent almost four years in care, which forced the sale of their modest home — an asset which for so many like her is their whole life savings. Dementia is, and has long been, a most discriminated-against condition, which is why the Mail’s campaign is so important.  Pictured: Lord Blunkett with guide dog Cosby  While the NHS provides free treatment for those diagnosed with heart disease or cancer — and rightly so — people with dementia are left at the mercy of a broken social care system. The absence of financial support for every person with dementia should embarrass us all.  As the countless tragic cases highlighted by this paper have revealed, people are having to sell their family homes and use life savings just to pay for their basic care. And it’s not just people with dementia paying the price — the NHS is, too.  According to Alzheimer’s Society research, in just one year more than 70,000 people with dementia were forced to go to A&E because inadequate or scarce social care left them unprotected from avoidable emergencies such as falls, infections and dehydration — at an estimated cost to the NHS of £400 million.  If we want to remedy the betrayal of dementia patients, we must act now. For although the past 20 years has been filled with political promises, successive governments have failed to take much-needed action.  As soon as he was elected in 1997, Tony Blair claimed that he did not want ‘children to be brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home’.  A Royal Commission was convened, but its recommendation for free long-term personal care was rejected a year later.  And when Alan Johnson — whose support for a ‘National Care Service’ was also taken up by his immediate successor Andy Burnham — tried to revolutionise social care, Labour’s defeat in the election a year later meant their proposals were also shelved.  In the years since, from the Dilnot review’s proposals in 2011 for a cap on care payments to Theresa May’s call in the last election for the current asset level of £23,250 — above which patients must fund themselves — to be raised, every attempt to improve our care system has fallen on deaf ears.  The 850,000 people in the UK living with dementia deserve better. Rather than delay the current Green Paper on social care for a seventh time in two years, our Government must finally commit to long-term social care reform and find a way to sustainably fund dementia care for the future.  There is no other choice.  By 2021, one million people in the UK will have dementia, and they will all need good-quality social care. Yet as it stands, the number of care homes is actually in decline — from 18,000 to 16,600 in the past nine years.  It’s already taking its toll on our finances: people with dementia have spent one million days in hospital beds when they should have been in care or nursing homes — costing the NHS more than £340 million.  This is the stark reality our new Prime Minister will face.  To end the dementia care crisis, he — whoever he is — must act. We have no time to lose.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, Mar 3, 2020  Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19  by Andrew W. Saul  OMNS Mar 3, 2020 The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. 1 Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.  These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.  Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.  Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  An official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital 2 reads:  On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury ALI and acute respiratory distress ARDS.

3904649e,The coronavirus may have leaked from a lab,"Researchers in central China study coronavirus samples as some wonder whether the disease escaped from a Wuhan laboratory.  Researchers in central China study coronavirus samples as some wonder whether the disease escaped from a Wuhan laboratory. AFP via Getty Images  At an emergency meeting in Beijing held last Friday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke about the need to contain the coronavirus and set up a system to prevent similar epidemics in the future.  A national system to control biosecurity risks must be put in place “to protect the people’s health,” Xi said, because lab safety is a “national security” issue.  Xi didn’t actually admit that the coronavirus now devastating large swathes of China had escaped from one of the country’s bioresearch labs. But the very next day, evidence emerged suggesting that this is exactly what happened, as the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive entitled: “Instructions on strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology labs that handle advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus.”  Read that again. It sure sounds like China has a problem keeping dangerous pathogens in test tubes where they belong, doesn’t it? And just how many “microbiology labs” are there in China that handle “advanced viruses like the novel coronavirus”?  It turns out that in all of China there is only one. And this one is located in the Chinese city of Wuhan that just happens to be . . . the epicenter of the epidemic.  That’s right. China’s only Level 4 microbiology lab that is equipped to handle deadly coronaviruses, called the National Biosafety Laboratory, is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology.  Enlarge Image A member of a medical staff checks the body temperature of a patient who has displayed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. AFP via Getty Images  What’s more, the People’s Liberation Army’s top expert in biological warfare, a Maj. Gen. Chen Wei, was dispatched to Wuhan at the end of January to help with the effort to contain the outbreak.  According to the PLA Daily, Gen. Chen has been researching coronaviruses since the SARS outbreak of 2003, as well as Ebola and anthrax. This would not be her first trip to the Wuhan Institute of Virology either, since it is one of only two bioweapons research labs in all of China.  Does that suggest to you that the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2, may have escaped from that very lab, and that Gen. Chen’s job is to try and put the genie back in the bottle, as it were? It does to me.  Add to this China’s history of similar incidents. Even the deadly SARS virus has escaped — twice — from the Beijing lab where it was — and probably is — being used in experiments. Both “man-made” epidemics were quickly contained, but neither would have happened at all if proper safety precautions had been taken.  And then there is this little-known fact: Some Chinese researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals to street vendors after they have finished experimenting on them.  You heard me right.  Instead of properly disposing of infected animals by cremation, as the law requires, they sell them on the side to make a little extra cash. Or, in some cases, a lot of extra cash. One Beijing researcher, now in jail, made a million dollars selling his monkeys and rats on the live animal market, where they eventually wound up in someone’s stomach.  Enlarge Image Members of a police sanitation team spray disinfectant as a preventive measure against the spread of the coronavirus. AFP via Getty Images  Also fueling suspicions about SARS-CoV-2’s origins is the series of increasingly lame excuses offered by the Chinese authorities as people began to sicken and die.  They first blamed a seafood market not far from the Institute of Virology, even though the first documented cases of Covid-19 the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2 involved people who had never set foot there. Then they pointed to snakes, bats and even a cute little scaly anteater called a pangolin as the source of the virus.  I don’t buy any of this. It turns out that snakes don’t carry coronaviruses and that bats aren’t sold at a seafood market. Neither are pangolins, for that matter, an endangered species valued for their scales as much as for their meat.  The evidence points to SARS-CoV-2 research being carried out at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The virus may have been carried out of the lab by an infected worker or crossed over into humans when they unknowingly dined on a lab animal. Whatever the vector, Beijing authorities are now clearly scrambling to correct the serious problems with the way their labs handle deadly pathogens.  China has unleashed a plague on its own people. It’s too early to say how many in China and other countries will ultimately die for the failures of their country’s state-run microbiology labs, but the human cost will be high.  But not to worry. Xi has assured us that he is controlling biosecurity risks “to protect the people’s health.” PLA bioweapons experts are in charge.  I doubt the Chinese people will find that very reassuring. Neither should we.",false
eabcaf9a,"Leaving EU 'would cut migration by 100,000' - Migration Watch","Net migration could fall by about 100,000 a year if the UK leaves the EU and introduces work permits for EU citizens, a pressure group has said.  Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report disingenuous.  He said it was another example of fudging the facts.      Follow the latest updates with BBC Politics Live  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures. lineimage copyrightNot Specified Analysis The Union Jack flag next to the European Flagimage copyrightReuters image captionThe Conservatives have promised to hold an in/out referendum on the EU by the end of 2017  BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum. lineimage copyrightNot Specified 'Pressure on services'  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes.  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future, he said.  Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries, he said.  Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services.  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000. Graph showing long-term international migration to the UK  The figures should not be taken as a precise estimate but were intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined, it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are self-sufficient would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs. 'No evidence'  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left.  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics ONS figures  ",other
68bf269b,"WisDems: Farmers have been crushed by Trump’s failed COVID-19 response, but he’s been dragging them down his entire presidency","WISCONSIN — Trump’s failed COVID-19 response has crushed farmers in Wisconsin and across the country. Farmers have been dumping milk, setting their crops on fire, and euthanizing their livestock because there is no market for their products. All the while, millions of more Americans are going hungry because they lost their jobs.  But farmers were struggling long before coronavirus hit the United States. Trump’s chaotic trade wars, particularly with China, obliterated the markets Wisconsin farmers spent decades building in just a short few months. During this time Trump and his administration told Wisconsinites the pain would be “temporary,” that farmers were “over the hump,” and that small and medium-sized family farms should just get bigger if they want to survive.  Trump has never seen farmers as more than a political pawn critical to his reelection chances. He used their pain to push through a multi-billion dollar bailout program that was nothing more than a handout for large agricultural companies. After getting rolled by China on a trade deal that was a mere fraction of what he promised it would be, a recent news report confirms that Trump was never interested in bettering the lives of Wisconsin’s farmers and was simply looking out for his own political interests.  “Donald Trump crushed our farmers and the local economies they support because he only sees them as a bargaining chip, not human beings and Wisconsinites,” Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesperson Philip Shulman said. “Trump has been a lapdog for China as he has rolled over for them at every turn. It’s been made clear by recent news reports that Trump gambled with farmers’ livelihoods because he thought it would be good for his reelection prospects. But after decimating these communities, they’re not willing to give him another four years — they know they can’t afford it.”  Wisconsin Examiner: Farms go from frying pan of trade wars to fire of COVID-19  Coxhead said trade policies under President Donald Trump…contributed significantly to the plight of Wisconsin farmers in the last few years. The federal government’s management of the COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered the country’s — and Wisconsin’s — position in the world economy, he added.  Wisconsin State Farmer: Economic recovery after pandemic will be slow for farmers due to trade and internet issues  He also said the Trump administration’s volatile relationship with China, one of the country’s biggest trading partners, is a cause for concern. And a widespread lack of high-speed internet access in rural areas is causing many rural economies to fall behind entirely. “The global economic recovery, which will outpace the United States, is not really going to benefit us all that well because the administration has turned its back on international trade,” Coxhead said.  Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Coronavirus has hit Wisconsin dairy farms especially hard — some farmers may even have to dump milk  Coronavirus is delivering a blow to Wisconsin agriculture…export markets are threatened by global trade unrest, and some farms may not make it through the spring. “The coronavirus outbreak has caused milk prices to drop down to unprofitable levels this spring…We also need to be prepared for the scenarios that would require our members to dump milk”…”or dispose of it in some other manner,”…the stimulus package won’t resolve long-term issues such as increased global competition and trade wars that may arise from countries closing their borders to curb the spread of COVID-19.

d115ab59,Birth Certificates are Federal Bank Notes,"By The Truth Denied  The American Bank Note Bldg. American Bank Note Company is a subsidiary of American Banknote Corporation and products range from currencies and credit cards to passports, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates.  In the USA, citizens have never obtained their original Birth Certificates — what they possess is a copy. Furthermore, these ‘copies’ have a serial number on them, issued on special Bank Bond paper and authorized by “The American Bank Note Company”. More on this later.  The original birth or naturalization record for every U.S. Citizen is held with Washington, D.C. and the property and assets of every living U.S. Citizen is pledged as collateral for the National Debt.  Every citizen is given a number *the red number on the Birth Certificate and each live birth is reported to be valued at 650,000 to 750,000 Federal Reserve dollars in collateral from the Fed. Hence the saying “we are owned by the system”.LITERALLY.  FACT: The government recognizes two distinct classes of citizens: a state Citizen and a federal citizen. Learn the difference now.  “There are hundreds of thousands of sovereigns in the United States of America but I am not one of them. The sovereigns own their land in “allodium.” That is, the government does not have a financial interest in the their land. Because of this they do not need to pay property tax school tax, real estate tax. Only the powers granted to the federal government in the Constitution for the United States of America define the laws that they have to follow.  This is a very small subset of the laws most of us have to follow. Unless they accept benefits from or contract with the federal government, they do not have to pay Social Security tax, federal income tax, or resident individual state income tax.  They do not need to register their cars or get a driver’s license unless they drive commercially. They will not have to get a Health Security Card. They can own any kind of gun without a license or permit. They do not have to use the same court system that normal people do. ~  *See below for information re: State Citizenship How to become a…  “Unbeknownst to most people, the class termed “US citizen” did not exist as a political status until 1866. It was a class and “political status” created for the newly freed slaves and did not apply to the people inhabiting the states of the union who were at that time state Citizens.” ~ Mr. Richard James, McDonald, former law enforcement, California  Now do the math.  If indeed 317 million US citizens are worth an average of $700,000 in collateral for the US debt, that would mean the US is worth roughly 222 Trillion dollars.  Your birth certificate is really a bank note, which means you, the citizen are what is known in the stock market as a commodity.  DEFINITION of ‘Commodity’  1. A basic good used in commerce that is interchangeable with other commodities of the same type. Commodities are most often used as inputs in the production of other goods or services. The quality of a given commodity may differ slightly, but it is essentially uniform across producers. When they are traded on an exchange, commodities must also meet specified minimum standards, also known as a basis grade.  2. Any good exchanged during commerce, which includes goods traded on a commodity exchange.  So if you didn’t catch it the first time, I will repeat myself at the risk of being redundant. Us citizens are owned by The United States Federal reserve, a note in the stock exchange, being traded as a commodity.  The note is printed by The American Bank Note Company. Who are they?  Background on American Bank Note Company: The following was printed to the editor by the New York times.  AMERICAN BANK NOTE COMPANY, NEW-YORK, Saturday, Dec. 2, 1865.NEW YORK TIMES  “To the Editor of New-York Times:  The attention of this company has been drawn to a paragraph from the Washington Star of the 30th ult., giving an account of some examination made at the Treasury Department as to the evidence of the surreptitious impression of a genuine plate, used by the counterfeiter in printing the backs of the spurious one hundred dollar compound interest note, having been taken after or before the plates and dies prepared by the American Bank Note Company were delivered by that company to the Treasury Department.  This paragraph states this “investigation shows that the counterfeits are made up from a plate surreptitiously obtained from this the American Bank Note Company.”  This statement is supported by a supposed demonstration, which to those familiar with the business will need no refutation, and which would amuse the counterfeiter, whoever he may be. And as no other reason, and no actual proof is pretended to support this imputation upon the security of plates and dies in the custody of the company, the paragraph might be left to every careful reader’s own correction.  I beg, however, the favor of stating, through your paper, that this company is ready to submit to, and give every aid to, any examination into the matter which the Treasury Department may desire; and that “experts” or plain men, upon the most thorough scrutiny, will have no doubt that the surreptitious impression was made from the genuine plate in the hands of the government, and after it was changed from the condition in which it was delivered by this company. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,  ~GEO. W. HATCH, President.”  American Bank Note Company is a subsidiary of American Banknote Corporation and ABnote Group: http://abnote.com/  Today, following a variety of financial transformations, the American Banknote Corporation produces a wide variety of secure and official documents. With operations world wide its products range from currencies and credit cards to passports, driver’s licenses, and birth certificates.  How does this work?  Why didn’t you learn this in school? According to many sources, including an excerpt from researcher Brian Kelly,  “When the UNITED STATES declared bankruptcy, pledged all Americans as collateral against the national debt, and confiscated all gold, eliminating the means by which you could pay, it also assumed legal responsibility for providing a new way for you to pay, and it did that by providing what is known as the Exemption, an exemption from having to pay for anything. In practical terms, though, this meant giving each American something to pay with, and that \”something\” is your credit.      Your value to society was then and still is calculated using actuarial tables and at birth, bonds equal to this \”average value\” are created. I understand that this is currently between one and two million dollars. These bonds are collateralized by your birth certificate which becomes a negotiable instrument. The bonds are hypothecated, traded until their value is unlimited for all intents and purposes, and all that credit created is technically and rightfully yours.  In point of fact, you should be able to go into any store in America and buy anything and everything in sight, telling the clerk to charge it to your Exemption account, which is identified by a nine-digit number that you will recognize as your Social Security number without the dashes. It is your EIN, which stands for Exemption Identification Number.”  The FEDERAL RESERVE BANK is not owned and controlled by the U.S. Government, rather it is owned and operated by International families. You are owned by foreigners bankers and your physical body is a collateral bond that has been issued on all your future earnings, your children’s future earnings, etc. Were you taught this in school?  Why not?  If this is indeed the case, how do you change your current status?  The fact is, thousands of citizens have already changed their ‘slavery’ status by means of relinquishing the agreement and reverting to their Sovereign status inalienable rights, the status you were born with such as constitutional rights of life, liberty, and property which are not transferable and, thus, are termed inalienable.  Questions to ask yourself:  What type of person are you?  What class of citizen are you?  Can you change this status?  The Uniform Commercial Code UCC and the law of contracts make it difficult to conduct business in the USA. Now that you know your Birth certificateregistration of birth is nothing more than a Contract with the government, what will you do to change this? Did they tell you you were signing a contract. Did you know that you didn’t even have to register the birth?  How does one reclaim their state Citizenship?  Here is the starting point on how to restore your first class citizenship status. Here is a list of the papers contracts that a state Citizen should file to be free of federal adhesion contracts. Some of these can be done at the county recorder’s office, others must be sent to the District of Columbia. *Remember , it took a lifetime for you to accumulate all of this, it may take a few months to undo it all, but well worth it.  A notice of intent  A declaration of sovereignty.  An oath to your state.  A notice that you are using Federal Reserve Notes under protest.

You should pay off all mortgages, car loans, and any other loan that you have.  You may continue to receive postal matter with ZIP codes but you should not accept them. You should also remove your children from the schools that receive public money.  Here are just some of the rights that you GAIN BACK as a Sovereign Citizen.  The first thing a Sovereign becomes is immune to law, I.E. statutory, civil and vehicle codes. You no longer are subject to those laws they just do not apply to you.  You gain the ability to discharge anything in the legal arena of commerce using the laws of that system against the perpetrators that are currently using those laws against you for their gain.  Becoming the Sovereign Citizen you were born to be, which is the master over the legal system rather than the servant you are now as a statutory citizen. Note the Capitalization of the letter C You were born a Sovereign but it only lasted a few hours or maybe a day at the most before you were illegally brought into the system by contract known as a birth certificate. That certificate made you a servant to the world we know as the UNITED STATES and the so called American way.      Discharging your debts by bonds.      Never having to pay a traffic ticket again if you so choose.      You cannot be sued in any court in this country.      Legally eliminate paying income taxes both federal and state.

968462e8,"HPV vaccine benefits 'exceed expectations,' may lead to elimination of cervical cancer","The HPV vaccine is far more effective than expected, with benefits extending beyond those who receive the vaccine, a study published Wednesday finds.  The new study, published in The Lancet, suggests that the more people who receive the vaccine, the better. That’s because vaccination not only reduces rates of HPV infection and the presence of precancerous cells in the cervix in people who receive the vaccine, it also reduces rates of HPV-related diseases in people who were not vaccinated.  The findings come as a U.S. federal advisory panel recommended Wednesday that the HPV vaccine be given to both men and women up to age 26.  HPV, or human papillomavirus, is the leading cause of cervical cancer. The virus can also cause other cancers, including cancers of the penis, head and neck, as well as conditions like genital warts.  The HPV vaccine was first introduced in 2006. Since then, more than 115 countries and territories have implemented it in their vaccination programs. The World Health Organization recommends that girls ages 9 to 13 receive two doses of the vaccine.  “The impact of the HPV vaccination has actually exceeded expectations,” said Lauri Markowitz, associate director of science for HPV at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who worked on the study. The trials showed that HPV vaccines are very effective, and data from the real world has confirmed that.”  Indeed, the reductions in HPV infections and precancerous cells “are a first sign that vaccination could eventually lead to the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem,” the study's lead author, Mélanie Drolet, an epidemiologist at Laval University in Canada, said in a statement.  The Lancet study expanded upon a 2015 meta-analysis that had looked at the real-world effects of the vaccine. The new analysis was updated to include a total of 65 studies, which spanned eight years and included more than 60 million people living in 14 countries. Each study measured either changes in the number of new HPV infections, genital warts diagnoses or cases of abnormal cells associated with cervical cancer in countries before and after they adopted routine HPV vaccination in girls. Two countries included in the analysis, the U.S. and Australia, also recommend the vaccine for boys.  The impact of the HPV vaccination has actually exceeded expectations.  The researchers found that, in these countries, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of two strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of cervical cancers, HPV 16 and 18. There are more than 100 strains of HPV, 14 of which are known to cause cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against up to 9 strains. In addition, there was a decrease in the prevalence of precancerous cells in the cervix, which can develop into cancer.  What’s more, in countries where at least half the population that was targeted for vaccination had actually received the vaccine, researchers saw evidence of herd immunity, meaning there was a decrease in the prevalence of HPV-related diseases even among those who weren’t vaccinated. This is because vaccination leads to fewer HPV hosts.  These countries also saw a decrease in genital warts diagnoses among unvaccinated boys and older women. And among girls within the age groups targeted for vaccination, there were fewer diagnoses of three HPV strains that the vaccine does not specifically protect against, a phenomenon called cross-protection. Countries in which people in multiple age groups received the vaccine also saw a greater decrease in HPV-related disease.  This paper shows that with a broader age range that’s targeted, you’ll find greater impact in your vaccination program,” Markowitz told NBC News.  Lagging vaccination rates  Despite the widespread benefits of the vaccine, however, HPV vaccination rates in the U.S. are still lagging behind those of other adolescent immunizations. The U.S. was the first country to implement HPV vaccination for both genders, but the CDC has found that many parents and health care providers don’t yet see a need to vaccinate boys. Parents have also expressed concerns about the vaccine and its costs, the CDC found.  According to Debbie Saslow, managing director of HPV and gynecological cancers at the American Cancer Society, the lagging rates are not entirely because parents are against vaccinating their kids; rather, the way some doctors are presenting the vaccine also plays a role.  Two required vaccinations, for tetanus and meningitis, are administered at the same time as HPV, around age 12. Saslow said HPV is usually presented as an optional third vaccine at that time, and one that patients can delay another year.  “Providers often think they’re recommending all three vaccines, but they’re actually making the third, the HPV vaccine, optional,” Saslow told NBC News. “They’re just suggesting it or doctors are setting it apart from the other two in some way.”  The fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection could also be a hard concept for parents to come to terms with. Saslow said beliefs about sex may be a factor that deters parents from opting to have their children vaccinated against HPV.  “Despite all that, vaccination rates are continuing to grow,” she said.  Indeed, the number of adolescents in the U.S. who received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine has increased by 5 percent each year since 2013. The CDC recommends everyone receive the first dose by age 12. Though adults up to age 45 can still be vaccinated, the vaccine may be less effective. And while the WHO does recommend that girls 9 to 13 get vaccinated against HPV, it does not yet recommend that all genders receive the vaccination. That could change in response to study results that continue to show the vaccine has substantial impact on public health.  Cancer prevention  That impact on public health is cancer prevention. Ultimately, that’s the “main goal of the HPV vaccination program, Markowitz said. We’re seeing an impact on one of the HPV outcomes that is close to a cancer outcome.” Because cervical cancer can take decades to develop, it’s not yet possible to study the effects of the vaccine on cervical cancer rates, Drolet noted in the statement.  In particular, the study found the HPV vaccine led to a reduction in the rates of abnormal pap smear findings. Pap smears are used to detect abnormal cells in the cervix that can sometimes develop into cancer. Five to nine years after a population was vaccinated against HPV, the researchers found a more than 50 percent reduction in cases of these pre-cancerous cells in girls 15 to 19. In vaccinated women 20 to 24, there were one-third fewer cases of these cells.  A separate study, published in April in The BMJ, found a 90 percent reduction in cases of pre-cancerous cells in young women in Scotland within the first decade of introducing the HPV vaccine.  But vaccination is only one piece of cervical cancer prevention; screening is also necessary.  Whether or not a person has received the HPV vaccine, getting cervical cells regularly tested — through Pap tests and HPV screening — is still a crucial to reducing cases of cervical cancer and early detection, said Diane Harper, senior associate director of the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. Rates of invasive cervical cancer dropped significantly in the U.S. when cancer screening was introduced in the 1940s, and there were less than half the number of cases in 2007 that there were in 1973, largely due to screening.  “Vaccination and screening together make a program,” Harper told NBC News. “Very few HPV cases progress into cancer, but the only way we’re going to find those that do is through the screening program.”  FOLLOW NBC HEALTH ON TWITTER & FACEBOOK",true

7d53da1e,"Men must have sex at least 21 times a month, to avoid prostate cancer – expert","Ebeneezer, a medical doctor and a herbal practitioner at the Amuzu Hospital has instructed men to have sex at least 21 times a month to avoid prostate cancer.  She pointed out the need to have steady and frequent sex to avoid prostate cancer.  In a twitter video that has since gone viral online, the Doctor was seen advising men to have sex at least 21 times a month in order to check against prostate cancer.  She said her advise is as a result of research findings conducted at Harvard University which was published in a journal called the European Urology.  The research found that men who have frequent sex, do not have the chance to suffer prostate cancer hence others should follow in the same act, she added.  “We found that men reporting higher compared to lower ejaculatory frequency in adulthood were less likely to be subsequently diagnosed with prostate cancer.  This large prospective study provides the strongest evidence to date of a beneficial role of ejaculation in the prevention of prostate cancer,” the researchers said.",false
2a9c9dfe,New Research Study Clarifies Health Outcomes in Vaccinated versus Unvaccinated Children,"May 28, 2020  New Research Study Clarifies Health Outcomes in Vaccinated versus Unvaccinated Children  Print  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE – May 28, 2020  Contact:  Unvaccinated children are less likely to be diagnosed with developmental delays, asthma, and ear infections.  Redding CA— A new peer-reviewed study in the journal SAGE Open Medicine details the health outcomes of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children from three pediatric practices in the United States concludes that unvaccinated children have better health outcomes than their vaccinated peers.  Children in the study were followed continuously for a minimum of 3 years from birth. The study was based on medical records of over 2000 children enrolled in three pediatric practices and born between November 2005 and June 2015. Vaccination status was determined based on any vaccination received prior to one year of age which yielded 30.9% of the children in the unvaccinated group. Results show that vaccination before one year of age led to significantly increased odds of medical diagnoses of developmental delays, asthma and ear infections in children.  In a separate analysis, based on the number of vaccines received by one year of age, children receiving more vaccines were more likely to be diagnosed with gastrointestinal disorders compared to those who received no vaccines within the same timeframe. In temporal analyses, children vaccinated prior to six months of age showed significant risks of each of the disorders studied as compared to unvaccinated children in the same timeframe.  The study, coauthored by Dr. Brian Hooker and Mr. Neil Miller, is unique in that all diagnoses were verified using abstracted medical records from each of the participating pediatric practices. Lead author of the study, Dr. Hooker, stated, “The results definitely indicate better health outcomes in children who did not receive vaccines within their first year of life. These findings are consistent with additional research that has identified vaccination as a risk factor for a variety of adverse health outcomes . Such findings merit additional large-scale study of vaccinated and unvaccinated children in order to provide optimal health as well as protection against infectious diseases.”  ###",other
7132db2a,"Evidence of ballot dumping found in Wis., Mich.","OAN Newsroom  UPDATED 8:04 AM PT – Thursday, November 19, 2020  President Trump is pointing to the latest evidence of an illegal ballot-dump in Wisconsin. In a tweet Wednesday, the President said Democrat Joe Biden received a major dump of more than 143,000 ballots on the night after the election.  He noted, the illegal dump took place in the early morning hours on November 4 when Democrats realized they were losing in the state. The 2020 Trump campaign is now mounting a legal challenge to prevent the certification of fraudulent election results in Wisconsin.  Look at this in Wisconsin! A day AFTER the election, Biden receives a dump of 143,379 votes at 3:42AM, when they learned he was losing badly. This is unbelievable! pic.twitter.com/nhiLMmyHBn — Donald J. Trump @realDonaldTrump November 19, 2020  Meanwhile, witnesses of voting fraud in Detroit, Michigan have come forward to detail alleged ballot dumps in favor of Biden. In a video testimony Wednesday, poll worker Kristina Karamo said she personally witnessed spoiled and invalid ballots being awarded to Biden.  “It was like so much going on, but I did personally witness the ballots being delivered between 3 o’clock and 3:30 a.m.,” she stated. “So I did personally witness ballots arriving at the time.”  Karamo, who worked at Detroit’s TCF Center, also said election officials did not review signatures on ballots. She added, suspicious batches of ballots were delivered to the TCF Center at night and all of them went to Biden.  Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. is calling for an investigation of suspected voter fraud in key battleground states.  “We need to figure out how many votes came in after the deadline and the court has ruled those are illegal,” he noted. “Then if it’s a significant number, we need to figure out and readjust the totals so the votes will now be illegal.”  On Wednesday, the senator said the 2020 Trump campaign should check samples of 2,000 random votes for fraud and other irregularities. He added, this would allow officials to build a statistical model to prove rampant voter fraud in court.",false
2244d27f,Biden Promises To Outlaw Gas-Powered Cars If Elected President,"I&I Editorial  Joe Biden’s $2 trillion climate change plan, released this week, was described by one liberal outlet as “the Green New Deal, minus the crazy.” We beg to differ. Just look at Biden’s plan to eliminate the internal combustion engine.  Biden says that on his first day in office, he will develop “rigorous new fuel economy standards aimed at ensuring 100% of new sales for light- and medium-duty vehicles will be zero emissions.”  He hasn’t said exactly when he wants new cars to be all-electric, but House Democrats have already established a timetable. Their new climate change plan calls for mandating 100% “clean” vehicles by 2035.  Keep in mind that as of today, plug-in electrics account for 0.5% of cars on the road, and made up less than 2% of new vehicles sold in 2019. And that’s despite massive public subsidies that have cost taxpayers $5 billion in credits to — mostly wealthy — EV buyers.  Clearly, consumers are not that interested in plug-ins, which is why Biden and his fellow Democrats want to force electric cars on everyone in the name of climate change.  Aside from fuel economy mandates, Biden also wants to extend and expand the EV tax credit, pump federal money into charging stations, and create a new “cash for clunkers” program for those who trade in a gasoline-powered car for a plug-in.  The cost of all this? Who knows. Aside from the $2 trillion price tag that Biden put on his entire Green New Deal plan, he hasn’t broken down his EV mandate scheme. But Sen. Chuck Schumer has already proposed a cash-for-clunkers plan, which would cost $454 billion over a decade.  And for all this, the electric car mandate will have a negligible impact on CO2 emissions and zero impact on the climate.  For one thing, the CO2 advantage of electric cars is vastly oversold. These are not “zero emissions” vehicles. They simply change the source of the emissions from the car to power plants — most of them powered by coal and natural gas.  A study by the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute found that when you factor in CO2 emissions from electricity production, the average plug-in produces as much CO2 over its lifetime as a gas-powered car that gets 55 miles per gallon.  The CO2 advantage of electric cars diminishes even more when you consider the entire lifecycle of the vehicle, including the environmental impact of mining required to manufacture the batteries. A study by the Union of Concerned Scientists found that CO2 emissions from manufacturing electric cars was 68% higher than gas-powered cars.  When you add it up, the impact on the climate is zero. A report from the Manhattan Institute notes that even if every car on the road were replaced with electric vehicles by 2050, “the resulting reduction in CO2 emissions would be less than 500 million tons per year.” That reduction, it says “will have no measurable impact on world climate.”  The rest of Biden’s environmental plan is equally untethered from reality. Take his proposal to have all the nation’s electricity produced by “clean” fuels by 2035.  Today, 20% of electricity comes from renewable sources. The Energy Information Administration says that based on current trends, that will increase to 32% by 2035 and 38% by 2050.  That’s a long way from 100%.  Plus, a fifth of today’s renewable energy comes from hydroelectric power, which has been declining as a source of energy in part because environmentalists hate dams. Another 43% comes from biomass, which environmentalists also consider dirty.  As the Natural Resources Defense Council put it, “biomass energy damages our climate and air, our forests, and our communities while the industry hides behind veils of misinformation.  That leaves solar and wind, which are massive land hogs. Proposed solar plants in Virginia would eat up 490 square miles of land — which would be like covering all of Los Angeles in solar panels. A single 50 turbine wind farm requires 23 square miles, notes Real Clear Investigations. Both energy sources are uneconomical without generous government subsidies.  Then there’s Biden’s promise that the entire U.S. economy will produce zero carbon emissions by 2050.  When the Heritage Foundation tried to calculate the economic impact of the carbon taxes needed to cut CO2 emissions by just more than half, it crashed their economic model.  The Green New Deal was never about saving the planet. It’s always been about the left’s desire to gain control of every aspect of our economy and our lives. Biden’s version might be a modestly watered-down version of the one proposed by socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, but it’s hardly any less crazy.  Update: A “fact-checking” site took issue with the headline of this editorial, claiming it was false, which led Facebook to put a warning label on our post claiming the same thing. We took issue with that in a follow-up editorial. We’d also note that since this editorial posted, Biden picked Kamala Harris as his running mate.

e3f1155e,"Kimchi May Have Helped Lower South Korea’s COVID-19 Fatalities, European Study Suggests","Editor’s Note: The headline of this article has been altered to more accurately reflect how findings of the study on fermented cabbage in Europe may correlate with kimchi, a fermented cabbage, in South Korea and other Asian countries in helping to lower COVID-19 fatalities.  Low COVID-19 fatality rates in South Korea may be attributed to kimchi, a recent study has found.  The study: A team of researchers in France, led by Pulmonary Medicine at Montpellier University honorary professor Dr. Jean Bousquet, conducted a study on the dietary preferences of countries with low fatalities from the novel coronavirus.       Reported in Clinical and Translational Allergy, a similar study found that countries where diet mainly consists of fermented cabbage had lower reported deaths from the virus.     According to the report, fermented cabbage in dishes helps in reducing levels of ACE2, an enzyme in the lungs that COVID-19 uses to gain access to the bodies of patients.      With a lower amount of ACE2, it becomes more difficult for the virus to enter the body, reported The Sun.  Which countries specifically: In South Korea, where the fermented cabbage dish kimchi is a staple food, 296 people have died out of 13,771 infected with COVID-19, registering a fatality rate of 2.14%.  Read More Advertisement      Meanwhile, Germany’s sauerkraut is also seen as a reason for their low death rate of 4.51% 9,163 deaths out of 202,845 cases as of this writing.  In Italy 14.33%, Spain 9.24% and the United Kingdom 15.36%, and other countries where fermented cabbage is not a regular part of the diet, the death rate is comparatively higher.       Consumption of yogurt or caviar has also helped Greece, Bulgaria and Turkey to have low COVID-19 death rates.     “Coronavirus binds to ACE2 that induces oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. Fermented foods have potent antioxidant activity and can protect against severe Covid-19,” Dr Bousquet, the former Chairman of the WHO Global Alliance against Chronic Respiratory Diseases, noted in the report.  Power of kimchi: In addition to the high antioxidants and vitamin C packed in cabbage, the fermentation process creates probiotics that support the “gut microbiome,” which helps for a better immune response in the body, multiple studies have shown.      In a separate study by the University of Leipzig in Germany, it was found that eating fermented food can give a boost to a person’s immune system.    Earlier research has also pointed out the benefits of healthy intestinal microbiome in fine-tuning the immune system and preventing damaging inflammation inside the body.     Back in April, the New York Post reported on the surge in sales of both sauerkraut and kimchi amid the pandemic.     New York-Presbyterian and Weill Cornell Medicine Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology clinical chief Dr. Robert Brown attributed such rise in sales in the perception that these types of food will protect them against the virus.     “When there’s a perception that there’s very little else you can do, you want to do something,” Dr. Brown said.  Not a miracle drug: When COVID-19 started to spread globally in January, South Korea’s Health Ministry released a statement warning that kimchi should not be seen as a “wonder drug” against the virus.      In a press release, the ministry cautioned that the Korean staple food provides no protection against the virus, noting that the best protection is frequent hand washing. ",false
18d2b528,BREAKING: US Military at the White House Arresting Congress," Special Operations SOF units including 4,000 deputized National Guard soldiers acting as US Marshalls, have served indictments on, or were about to arrest 67% of Congress. Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am Military vans, buses and police cars, along with a multitude of police and Military troops, were very busy at a blacked out White House. “I just watched everyone in the White House arrested” declared an unnamed person doing one of the two videos shown below. Video contains graphic language https://youtu.be/ywfXNGNvvuU Even though the Mass Media have refused to report it, the US has been functioning under Martial Law since Sat. 9 Jan. An Interim Military US Government was actually running the US and they saw President Biden as a treasonous agent. A few days before Joe Biden’s Inauguration and due to foreign interference in the 2020 Presidential Election, Trump had instigated the Insurgency Act, declared Martial Law and deferred his power to the US Military. Early Mon. morning 25 Jan. between 3 and 6 am a blackout occurred in Washington DC around the White House. According to two separate videos taped at the scene, police and US troops were everywhere in the darkness. Military vans, buses and police cars pulled up to the White House, loaded passengers, took them down the road and across a bridge and then some vans came back empty to do a repeat. Mustang Medic’s recording showed many buses and vans, some marked as Military, entering the Capitol grounds. Several people were taped getting out of their cars, showing IDs to guards and then walking into the grounds. https://rumble.com/vdawtd-mass-arrest-at-the-capitol.html When it was over and seemingly on Q, fireworks lit up the sky. Reports from those on the ground claimed that by later that day the White House was closed up tight and remained so as of right now. https://youtu.be/iqjVRcSejWU Evidently Biden’s team was not in the White House, but detained and arrested behind the scenes. The US Military was expected to have arrested Harris on charges of treason, while invoking the 25th Amendment on Biden because of his dementia and subsequent inability to hold office. The Deep State had plans to invoke the 25th on Biden, put Harris in his place and Pelosi as VP. Not going to happen. On Fri. 22 Jan. a Juan O Savin reported that the US Interim Military Government was about to arrest Joe Biden and his traitor Deep State politicians in DC. Crimes of these elite politicians have recently been exposed from findings of the Russia hoax Mueller probe, impeachments of Trump and Obamagate. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT57EP1wL9g&feature=share It was reported that to date, 260 global elites have been served, “The deal that they got was that if they gave information that was useful, they could have a better death, or a jail cell for life.

fff1cb16,BOMBSHELL: Covid-19 infection rate may be 440% higher among children who received FLU SHOTS… while health “authorities” madly push more shots for the coming flu season,"Natural News A 2012 study published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases finds that children who received inactivated influenza vaccines were 440% more likely relative risk: 4.40; 95% confidence interval: 1.31-14.8 to acquire infections of respiratory viral pathogens which are not influenza. With the aggressive push for influenza immunizations now under way, the medical establishment may be setting up children to be extremely vulnerable to coronavirus infections. Titled, “Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine,” the study is found at this link at the National Library of Medicine: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/ The study finds that flu shots quite literally inactivate parts of the human immune system, rendering the child more vulnerable to coronavirus infections. “Being protected against influenza, trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine recipients may lack temporary non-specific immunity that protected against other respiratory viruses,” the study authors write. The study authors explain that the influenza vaccine works to prevent influenza virus infections, but at the same time it makes children more susceptible to other respiratory infections. Since the Infection Fatality Rate IFR for seasonal influenza is so low around 0.024%, which is not a typo, and the Infection Fatality Rate of covid-19 infections is at least one order of magnitude higher, it raises the obvious question: Would it save more lives of children to avoid administering flu shots this year and therefore reduce their vulnerability to covid-19, which has a far higher fatality rate? The study, which was conducted in 2009, observed the outcomes of 115 children aged 6 – 16 years. The study also used a placebo group and found that placebo made “no statistically significant difference” in the risk of acute respiratory infection risk. But children who received influenza vaccines had a much higher risk of respiratory infections. Even more shockingly, the study also found no difference in the risk of seasonal influenza infections between those children who were vaccinated vs. those who weren’t. In other words, the influenza vaccine offered no protection against the flu, but it created increased vulnerability to other respiratory infections. No benefits, just increased risks. “There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influenza infection between recipients of TIV or placebo,” the study explains. You can see the increased number of respiratory infections in this chart. Note the “TIV” column means those children who were vaccinated with an influenza vaccine: The conclusion is that influenza vaccines make children more susceptible to other respiratory viral infections. From the study, which took place more than a decade before the arrival of the covid-19 pandemic: We identified a statistically significant increased risk of noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients Table 3, including significant increases in the risk of rhinovirus and coxsackie/echovirus infection, which were most frequently detected in March 2009, immediately after the peak in seasonal influenza activity in February 2009. The study authors point out that the influenza vaccine, “could increase influenza immunity at the expense of reduced immunity to noninfluenza respiratory viruses, by some unknown biological mechanism,” although they also state more research is needed because some of the self-reporting of symptoms may have introduced “artifacts” which could sway the numbers. Nevertheless, the study authors also state that this phenomenon of “viral interference” is well known: Participants who received TIV would have been protected against influenza in February 2009 but then would not have had heightened nonspecific immunity in the following weeks… The phenomenon of virus interference has been well known in virology for >60 years [24–27]. Ecological studies have reported phenomena potentially explained by viral interference [3–11]… Interference in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections has been reported after receipt of live oral poliovirus vaccine [29–32]. Those who push flu shots may be worsening the coronavirus pandemic The upshot of this research is that those who are pushing flu shots for children may in fact be worsening the coronavirus pandemic, creating “perfect storm” conditions for children to become carriers of the Wuhan coronavirus that causes covid-19. This is consistent with the fact that we now know the medical establishment has acted to deliberately worsen covid-19 fatalities by, for example, conspiring the destroy the credibility of hydroxychloroquine, working to maximize fatalities in order to reap a windfall of profits from the coronavirus vaccine. Yes, the medical and science establishment quite literally arranges for more people to die in order to keep the coronavirus fear alive, resulting in more demand for high-profit vaccines. As always, it’s all about the money. As Gary Heavin recently wrote in a warning to America, Big Pharma operatives are “accessories to murder.” How does Big Pharma have so much control over the dissemination of this information or should I say propaganda? Well, the same answer pops up again, money. Big Pharma gave $2 billion dollars during the last election cycle to US politicians. Big AG, the military/security complex and big oil each gave only a paltry $1.0 billion dollars to buy the votes of our political leadership. The MSM counts Big Pharma’s advertising revenue at up to 80% of their income. The internet’s “masters of the universe” also kowtow to Big Pharma’s influence and advertising dollars by censoring anyone who tries to tell the American people the truth about Covid 19. It certainly appears that anyone who is complicit in this Great Deception, a deception that is designed to kill and terrify enough people to ultimately beg for an experimental vaccine, well, these people would be accessories to murder. Flu shots are being hyped to suppress immune systems and create an explosion in coronavirus infections Flu shots, it seems, are one more way the medical establishment can literally murder children and adults, creating widespread vulnerability to the coronavirus pandemic which will no doubt surge back this Fall as flu shots work to suppress the immune systems of millions. Recognize that the people pushing flu shots are medical murderers, and many are deliberately trying to kill as many people as possible to create demand for the high-profit coronavirus vaccines that are about to be unleashed on America, probably before the end of this year. It’s the perfect crime: Manufacture vaccines that suppress the immune system right in the middle of a pandemic, causing more infections and deaths, leading to more calls for mandatory vaccines. The drug companies will cash in to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars while innocent children and adults all across America needlessly suffer and die. As usual, it’s all about the money, and the vaccine / drug cartels are murderous, criminal regimes that twisted science Dr. Fauci? to maximize profits at any cost.

That’s how to save social security.”  The remarks were made following a Senate Sub-committee meeting on how to keep Social Security from being taken over by those who would oppose one of the great hallmarks of our capitalist economy. It is felt by many on The Hill that liberals are lying in wait to take over the program and put their grubby socialist mark all over it. This was evidenced by the words of Miss Talia.  But she didn’t stop with that remark. Talia’s disgusting rant was captured on cell phone video by a passerby so we have all the details :  “Seriously, why do we even keep them around? I mean thank you for your service but you no longer serve any purpose in society. There’s so damn many of them now. Boomers. Our infrastructure can’t support them. Socialism is about protecting the good of all. The few make sacrifices for the whole. Geriatrics should be saying to themselves,’We are a burden on society. Our children will suffer for our selfishness in staying alive.’ And all they talk about is patriotism. Caring for your country. If they were really patriotic, they’d be lining up to be euthanized. Or, better yet, they’d save the government the money and take care of it themselves.”  The government ethics committee intends to look into the remarks of Sen. Talia. If it is found that her words amount to hate speech, she could be removed from office and jeered for having such thoughts. Here’s hoping.",false

Leno was a huge Trump supporter and a lifelong Republican. He truly believed in the causes of freedom and limited government, the kind Trump is so strongly in favor of, especially when he says he has “absolute authority.” Jay Leno will be sorely missed by his friends in the Republican party.  Conservatives have always praised Leno for his comedic style, which didn’t make fun of Republicans like the current “comedians” do. He was seen as fair and balanced in his jokes which is why many believe he was so popular for so long.  Leno leaves behind his wife, kids, and many grandchildren. They will be inheriting his massive garage of cars, including Leno’s prized 2012 Mini Cooper S.  A lifelong friend of Leno, Joe Barron, shared his memories:  “I’m speechless. Jay was such a great guy, I ve known him since we were 10 years old. When I saw the news this morning, I couldn’t believe it! Jay couldn’t be dead. I refused to believe it and I just knew it had to be from one of those clearly labeled satire sites that lazy fact-checkers waste their time ‘fact checking.’ I was relieved to find out it was. Such a relief. It just feels like yesterday we were in the schoolyeard making jokes and playing with our model cars. It just doesn’t feel real.” He will be sorely missed by me and my family and we wish his family the best in this difficult time.”  RIP Jay Leno.",false
29b21551,Democrats colluding with CIA to launch intelligence operation that ALTERS voting machine results: Report,"Dave Janda of Operation Freedom www.DaveJanda.com has unleashed a bombshell story with huge implications for Tuesday’s elections. Janda’s guest in his latest broadcast is a former high-level intelligence official Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney who warns that the Dems and the CIA have put in place a mechanism which can alter the voting results of electronic voting machines in key swing states like Pennsylvania that will determine the outcome of the election.  This covert technology is called Operation Scorecard, and it was built by the CIA to surreptitiously steal elections in targeted countries. Now, that technology is being turned against the United States of America and is about to be activated on Tuesday to steal the election for Biden, explains Janda’s guest.  OmegaManRadio, a pro-liberty, pro-Christian podcast channel, has reposted portions of the Dave Janda interview at this link on Soundcloud.com. Start listening around the 20 minute mark to hear the bombshell segments.  The original interview from Dave Janda is currently available via YouTube but is likely to be blacklisted soon. Here’s the YouTube embed:  As McInerney explains in the video, after the closing of polls in Pennsylvania and other swing states, the voting machines will be intercepted and then altered using complex algorithms to alter the votes in a way that evades detection, handing a victory to the pre-designated “winner” Joe Biden.  Smells like FREEDOM. Order Founders Blend Organic Coffee from Freedom First Coffee. Use NOQ as the promo code for 10% off!  In the interview, he explains that a covert app called “Scorecard” steals votes by making sure Democrats always stay about 3% ahead of their Republican rivals. “Scorecard steals the elections by tampering with the computers at the transfer points,” he adds.  This also explains why Joe Biden recently said, with great clarity, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.”  Here’s the video of Biden bragging about the massive voter fraud system that’s being used to try to to steal the election for him:  This might also help explain why Joe Biden told voters at a recent small rally that he didn’t “need their vote” to become President, and why Nancy Pelosi says Biden will win no matter what the votes say on Nov. 3rd.  The deep state has a plan in place to steal this election by altering votes in key swing states. And if Trump challenges the fraud, he will be condemned for “refusing to accept the outcome” of the rigged election. This is the narrative trap that has been set by the treasonous mainstream media.  Keep in mind that just over the last two days, Trump campaign officials were asking for detailed information about how voting machines are handled in Pennsylvania. According to the anti-Trump Washington Post a deep state propaganda mouthpiece:  …the Trump campaign asked officials in Cumberland County for the names of people who transport ballots and voting machines once polls close, the names of people who have access to the ballots afterward, and the precise locations where the ballots are stored, including room numbers.  It seems that Trump’s people are already aware that Dems are working to fraudulently steal this election by altering votes in Pennsylvania, and they’re trying to stop it.  Be aware that unless Trump receives an overwhelming wave of votes on Tuesday — beyond the margin of Democrat fraud — the Dems have a mechanism in place to steal the election, condemn Trump for challenging the vote theft, and seizing control of the White House from this day forward.  Spread this story far and wide. Everything is now at stake.  RED ALERT: Dems collude with CIA to launch intelligence operation that ALTERS voting machine results in Pennsylvania and other swing states  Update:  COVID-19 may take down an independent news outlet  Nobody said running a media site would be easy. We could use some help keeping this site afloat.  Colleagues have called me the worst fundraiser ever. My skills are squarely rooted on the journalistic side of running a news outlet. Paying the bills has never been my forte, but we’ve survived. We have ads on the site that help, but since the site’s inception this has been a labor of love that otherwise doesn’t bring in the level of revenue necessary to justify it.  When I left a nice, corporate career in 2017, I did so knowing I wouldn’t make nearly as much money. But what we do at NOQ Report to deliver the truth and fight the progressive mainstream media narrative that has plagued this nation is too important for me to sacrifice it for the sake of wealth. We know we’ll never make a ton of money this way, and we’re okay with that.  Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called “surge” or “2nd-wave” that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy. In short, we are now in desperate need of financial assistance.  The best way NOQ Report readers can help is to donate. Our Giving Fuel page makes it easy to donate one-time or monthly. Alternatively, you can donate through PayPal as well. We need approximately $11,500 to stay afloat for the rest of 2020, but more would be wonderful and any amount that brings us closer to our goal is greatly appreciated.  The second way to help is to become a partner. We’ve strongly considered seeking angel investors in the past but because we were paying the bills, it didn’t seem necessary. Now, we’re struggling to pay the bills. This shouldn’t be the case as our traffic the last year has been going up dramatically. June, 2018, we had 11,678 visitors. A year later in June, 2019, we were up to 116,194. In June, 2020, we had 614,192.

Interested investors should contact me directly with the contact button above.  Election year or not, coronavirus lockdowns or not, anarchic riots or not, the need for truthful journalism endures. But in these times, we need as many conservative media voices as possible. Please help keep NOQ Report going.  Join fellow patriots as we form a grassroots movement to advance the cause of conservatism. The coronavirus crisis has prompted many, even some conservatives, to promote authoritarianism. It’s understandable to some extent now, but it must not be allowed to embed itself in American life. We currently have 8000+ patriots with us in a very short time.

Without this, we are just a land of savages like other places that have rejected Christianity.  Just look at Nazi Germany and New Zealand. These places are not places we want to be like, but without God in our lives, we soon will be headed down that path.  Our President Donald Trump understands this more than anyone. That is why he has worked so hard on crafting his most recent Executive Order. It will allow churches to operate as the essential businesses that they are.  Executive Order 66 states the following:  “As of today, all churches in the United States of America are classified as essential businesses. This will require them to remain open for all people at all times. In addition, since they are now classified as businesses, they will be entitled to taxation provisions by the IRS. In essence, they will now pay the taxes they have been avoiding for all these years.”  This is great news for Americans. They can get back to church and God will be back. The best part of this order for America is the taxation provisions. The nation will have so much revenue, we won’t know what to do with it. We will pay off the debt in record time, just as Trump claimed.  The president is said to be working on a new Executive Order, opening up the rest of the country as soon as possible.

Evers’ plan provides roadblocks to reopening Wisconsin","Madison, WI…Speaker Robin Vos R-Rochester and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald R-Juneau released the following statement after the Evers administration announced guidelines for reopening the state.  “Instead of listening to the resounding outcry from the people of the state, Governor Evers is now making it harder to reopen Wisconsin. He claims to be following the CDC guidelines, but instead is expanding on them, saying we need to hire 1000 new contract tracers when positive cases aren’t significantly increasing. The governor also wants to postpone reopening until we increase testing when we are currently using only around 20% of our testing capacity. These are not criteria for reopening, they’re roadblocks.  “While DHS reports that 60% of counties have fewer than 10 cases, and 10% have none, Governor Evers is doubling down on his plan to keep the entire state locked down until after Memorial Day, well past every state in the region.  “We continue to call on the governor to retreat from his one-size-fits-all approach and allow the state to safely open up regionally so people can get back to work. Wisconsin is a diverse state; obviously, the Northwoods can’t be treated like Dane and Milwaukee counties. Using the CDC guidelines, it appears portions of the state would be only days away from the first phase of reopening.  “Wisconsinites need certainty during these uncertain times. As we have seen too often throughout the pandemic, the governor says something one day and the opposite the next. That is why we can’t afford to withdraw our impending legal action. Too much is at stake. It’s clear one person shouldn’t be allowed to unilaterally rule over businesses, families and the state’s future.”",partially false

The allegations are aimed at election officials from Detroit and Wayne County, according to a release from the center, and are based on affidavits of named individuals who said they witnessed misconduct.  “This type of widespread fraud in the counting and processing of voter ballots cannot be allowed to stand. Michigan citizens are entitled to know that their elections are conducted in a fair and legal manner and that every legal vote is properly counted,” senior counsel David A. Kallman said in a statement.  “Such rampant fraud cannot be undone. We ask the Court to enjoin the certification of this fraudulent election, void the election, and order a new vote in Wayne County.”  Michigan, along with Pennsylvania, are two major states targeted by President Donald Trump’s campaign, which has alleged widespread voter fraud linked to mail-in ballots cast there.  TRENDING: Liberal Author Naomi Wolf: If I'd Known Biden Supports Lockdowns, 'I Never Would Have Voted for Him'  The lawsuit, filed by poll challengers Cheryl A. Costantino and Edward P. McCall Jr., cite what the legal filing calls “numerous issues of fraud and misconduct.”  The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining order that would prohibit officials from certifying the vote until the charges made in the lawsuit can be investigated.  “Defendants systematically processed and counted ballots from voters whose name failed to appear in either the Qualified Voter File QVF or in the supplemental sheets. When a voter’s name could not be found, the election worker assigned the ballot to a random name already in the QVF to a person who had not voted,” the complaint reads.  “Defendants instructed election workers to not verify signatures on absentee ballots, to backdate absentee ballots, and to process such ballots regardless of their validity,” the complaint went on, adding another allegation that election workers were told “to process ballots that appeared after the election deadline and to falsely report that those ballots had been received prior to November 3, 2020 deadline.”  Do you believe vote fraud happened in Michigan?

There were tens of thousands of these absentee ballots, and apparently every ballot was counted and attributed only to Democratic candidates,” the complaint read.  “Unsecured ballots arrived at the TCF Center loading garage, not in sealed ballot boxes, without any chain of custody, and without envelopes.”  The complaint alleged that some ballots arrived in vehicles with out-of-state license plates, and that “[i]t was observed that all of these new ballots were cast for Joe Biden.”  The complaint went on to claim that election workers “systematically used false information to process ballots, such as using incorrect or false birthdays. Many times, the election workers inserted new names into the QVF after the election and recorded these new voters as having a birthdate of 1/1/1900.”  RELATED: Federal Investigators Arrive in Michigan After Viral Video Seems To Reveal Alleged Fraud  Oversight was denied, according to the complaint.  “Defendant election officials and workers refused to record challenges to their processes and removed challengers from the site if they politely voiced a challenge. After poll challengers started discovering the fraud taking place at the TCF Center, Defendant election officials and workers locked credentialed challengers out of the counting room so they could not observe the process, during which time tens of thousands of ballots were processed,” the complaint read.  “Defendant election officials and workers allowed ballots to be duplicated by hand without allowing poll challengers to check if the duplication was accurate. In fact, election officials and workers repeatedly obstructed poll challengers from observing. Defendants permitted thousands of ballots to be filled out by hand and duplicated on site without oversight from poll challengers.”  Detroit’s lawyer in the case said the lawsuit will go nowhere.  “Like two previous lawsuits, this case is not based upon actual evidence of any election fraud or misconduct, it is based upon various conspiracy theories, which have already been debunked,” David Fink told The Detroit News. “We are confident this case, like the others filed last week, will be dismissed.”  This article appeared originally on The Western Journal.",false
a94e340d,Biden's claim about attending historically Black Delaware State refuted by university,"Joseph R. Biden declared last year on the campaign trail that he began his academic career at Delaware State University, a historically Black college, a claim that the school refutes.  Carlos Holmes, director of news service for Delaware State, said that Mr. Biden was never a student, although he has made appearances twice on campus for commencement speeches at the public university in Dover, one of the nation’s historically Black colleges and universities HBCUs.  “Vice President Biden did not attend DSU,” said Mr. Holmes in a Thursday email. “However he was the Commencement keynote speaker in 2003 and [2016], and during the former he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree.”  Mr. Biden made the claim ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary during a town hall held Oct. 26, 2019, at historic Wilson High School in Florence, which was founded in 1866 by the Freedmen’s Bureau for Black children seeking an education.  “I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State — now, I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State,” Mr. Biden told the audience, drawing laughter, as shown on video. “They’re my folks.”  Mr. Biden, who went on to win the South Carolina primary on his way to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been long accused of making up the DSU connection, but the university’s denial appears to erase any doubt.  The Washington Times has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.  Mr. Biden’s 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep,” proceeds from his years at Archmere Academy, a private Catholic school in Clayton, Delaware, to his enrollment as a freshman at the University of Delaware without mentioning Delaware State.  Biden claims he “got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State” when he did not attend the universitypic.twitter.com/LnBOS1wQlT — Tommy Pigott @TCPigott October 26, 2019  The former vice president has been caught numerous times embellishing his biography, including statements that he was the first in his family to attend college and that his relatives worked as coal miners, both of which he later admitted were false.  Mr. Biden has also been accused of exaggerating his record on civil-rights activism, such as his assertions about participating in marches. During his first presidential run in 1987, for example, he declared that he “marched with tens of thousands,” a claim that has been largely discounted.  The 2010 biography “Joe Biden” by veteran political reporter Jules Witcover described him as someone who was sympathetic to the movement but “was taking no visible part in either the local racial unrest or the war protest.”  “It was not until his exposure to black contemporaries as a lifeguard, he said, that he finally began to understand, and then he saw his best engagement as a lawyer, not a marcher,” the book said.  Earlier this month, the Biden campaign named DSU President Tony Allen, who previously worked as a speechwriter in Mr. Biden’s Senate office, to the Biden transition team advisory council.

062088e4,Where Will Austin Go For Water Next?,"Where Will Austin Go For Water Next? By Terrence Henry Email  Tweet    REUTERS /JULIA ROBINSON /LANDOV  The Highland Lakes, the main reservoirs for over a million people in and around Austin, are only a third full. They could reach their lowest levels in history this summer.  As the shores of those lakes receded during the Texas drought, businesses dried up and water quality declined. If you take a trip out to Lake Travis today, you’ll notice the most popular shorebird is the vulture. With the lake 46 feet below where it should be, there’s plenty of shoreline for them.  If the main water supply of a million people is at risk, what’s the ‘Plan B?’  “Unfortunately, there is no ‘Plan B,'” says state Sen. Troy Fraser R-Horseshoe Bay. “We are totally dependent on Mother Nature in this area. It’s really a problem.”  But it’s a problem that finally seems to have gotten the attention of Austin’s city leaders.  Photo by Filipa Rodrigues/StateImpact Texas  The city’s main strategy to deal with the drought up until now has been conservation, and Austinites have answered the call. Per capita, the city is using less water than ever, according to Greg Meszaros, Director of Austin Water.  But rain continues to miss the lakes. Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didn’t help either.  “Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austin’s water use” was sent to rice farmers that year, Meszaros says.  Another silent straw is sucking up water from the lakes: evaporation.The lakes lose almost as much water to evaporation as the city uses every year. Now the city is starting to think about how to extend a shrinking supply.  Courtesy of CERES  Leading part of that effort is Sharlene Leurig, Director of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Program at Ceres, a non-profit specializing in sustainability. Leurig is chairing a new water resource task force under the direction of Austin’s City Council. Their aim is to find solutions that could boost Austin’s water supply.  “There’s no single project that will solve the challenge before us,” Leurig says. But there are a number of projects and tweaks that could significantly improve the situation. Forget big reservoirs: Austin is looking to get creative in finding more water.  Some of the solutions, Leurig says, are sitting right under Austin’s nose. Standing on the shores of Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin, surrounded by joggers and gazing out onto the dog park at Auditorium Shores, Leurig says the pass-through lake is more than just an aesthetic treat for Austinites.  Related Topics What Is The Lower Colorado River Authority?  “Use this as a storage supply,” she says. “That might actually accept treated wastewater produced by the city of Austin for reinjection back into our drinking water system.”  Once treated, Leurig says, the water would be purer than bottled water. Several other cities in Texas, including Wichita Falls, Brownwood and San Angelo are moving forward with or considering wastewater reuse programs.  It’s just one of the many smaller solutions on the Austin water supply smorgasbord, Meszaros of Austin Water says.  “For example, what’s called Walter E. Long Lake, or Decker Lake [in East Austin], there’s no technical reason you couldn’t use that lake as a complement to the water supply,” Meszaros says.  Other ideas on tap? Here are a few being considered by the water resource task force:  Fixing Longhorn dam to better control water flows.  Lowering Lake Austin to catch more rainfall.  Using aquifers underground to store water and prevent evaporation. Meszaros of Austin Water says the city would work to use land it could easily access in order to avoid potentially costly litigation.  Rainwater capture, distributed throughout the city, especially on commercial buildings downtown.  Using a biodegradable powder on the surface of lakes in Austin’s water supply to lower evaporation, starting with smaller lakes like Lady Bird Lake or Walter E. Long Lake.  Securing groundwater access from the Carrizo-Wilcox or Northern Edwards aquifers.  There’s no “silver bullet,” Meszaros says. “There’s no golden barrel of water out there that is vastly available and very low cost. If it were, people would have it already.”  Meszaros estimates that the right mix of projects could add roughly a quarter to nearly three-quarters of Austin’s annual water use from the Highland Lakes.  Leurig of the Water Resource Planning Task Force says the answer to strengthening Austin’s water supply is likely an “all of the above” strategy.  Such a hodge-podge of projects — even small ones — will take time and money. Some are costlier than others like aquifer storage and recovery, and how the city will prioritize and budget the projects remains to be seen. Austin Water is already preparing rate increases to make up for lost revenues during the drought.  Texas Tribune  “The unfortunate thing is, it doesn’t happen overnight,” says state Sen. Fraser.  “We’re about to go through a very hot, difficult summer that I’m very nervous about. Because this event we’re going through was preventable.”  The water resource task force has until June 20th to provide their recommendations to city council. What the council will decide to do then is an open question.  And the region’s water plan is undergoing changes that will likely result in far less water going to rice farmers during dry times. Meszaros of Austin Water says regardless, Austin will continue to rely on the Colorado system.  “The lakes aren’t going to run out of water in any immediate future,” he says. “But we’re gonna be in a potentially long-term situation where they’ll be at relatively low levels compared to their historic norms. Fundamentally, we’re going to be a Colorado River system water supply-driven community for many, many decades to come.”",true
b069c011,Sen. Van Wanggaard: Statement on statewide mask mandate,"“You can’t legislate common sense. For that reason, I continue to strongly oppose the one-size-fits all approach of Governor Evers’ response to coronavirus in this state, including the statewide mask mandate. It’s transparent and blatantly political that his order doesn’t take effect until his handpicked Supreme Court justice take office.  At a time when liberals across Wisconsin are trying to prevent arrests and fines for actual crimes committed, the last thing law enforcement needs to do is enforce mask wearing. It is the definition of misplaced priorities. This is especially true given the under-reporting of negative cases in at least two counties with high infection rates.  I can understand why some businesses are requiring masks. That is their choice, just as it is my choice to do business elsewhere. That’s what America is about. But no one is going to make me wear a mask in my house, or walking my dog. That is also what America is about – free choice.",false

Why they would pursue this is quite simple – they think of nobody but themselves. Their retirement income is guaranteed through fat congressional pensions in addition to the billions they steal from the taxpayer during their terms in office, so they have no worries.  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, today launched their latest attack on our beloved social safety net:  “Seniors in this country are soft! They actually rely on this pittance from the government in their latter years! Well guess what, people? This country is in trouble! We face financial ruin and hard choices have to be made about our money. Our situation is totally unsustainable because of the massive amounts of dough that our esteemed leader is adding to the debt.

Ginger has helped many a cancer patient fend off nausea and inflammation during treatment. Now it appears it can do even more.  Loading...  In a Georga State University study on the effects of ginger extract on living cells, researchers found that ginger extract induced growth-inhibition and death on cancerous cells, while leaving the healthy cells alone.  Ginger was found found to have virtually no side effects, which separates it from modern-day chemotherapy. Some forms of chemotherapy have actually been found to increase the rate of metastasis, causing cancer to appear in other organs that were unrelated to the organ being treated.  “Whatever manipulations we’re doing to tumors can inadvertently do something to increase the tumor numbers to become more metastatic, which is what kills patients at the end of the day,” said Dr. Raghu Kalluri, working on an unrelated study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.  At George State, the researchers found that ginger extract shrunk prostate tumors in mice by 56%, while reducing inflammation and providing anti-oxidants.  This study comes in addition to 17 other studies linking ginger to anti-cancer benefits. The plant has also been subjected to peer-reviewed studies that link it to healing when dealing with over 101 other diseases.  You can enjoy the benefits of ginger in various way, teas, extracts, supplements, and you can eat raw ginger to benefit quickly from its healing powers.  Source: Health Holistic Living",other
5ae71da3,Wasserman Schultz considering 2016 Senate bid,"Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, is strongly considering a bid for U.S. Senate, calculating that having Hillary Clinton at the top of the 2016 ticket would help lift her candidacy in a year-of-the-woman campaign.  Driving Wasserman Schultz’s interest: the increasing likelihood that Sen. Marco Rubio will run for the White House and that he ultimately won’t seek reelection in 2016, Democratic insiders familiar with her thinking say. Her office wouldn’t discuss her interest in the Senate.  “Of course she’s considering it: Open Senate seats are pretty rare,” said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime supporter of the Weston congresswoman and a 2012 member of President Barack Obama’s national finance team.  “If you’re a nationally known candidate with a strong fundraising record and a good relationship with your constituents and supporters, you would definitely look at it,” Weinstein added.  Like a number of Democratic insiders — four of whom spoke on condition of anonymity in confirming her Senate interest — Weinstein stressed he wasn’t favoring any potential candidate and didn’t want to appear to slight Rep. Patrick Murphy, who represents Florida’s 18th Congressional District and is considered the most likely Democrat to seek a Senate seat in 2016.  “He is very seriously considering the Senate race — whether Rubio runs or not,” said Eric Johnson, Murphy’s chief of staff and top political adviser.  Also expressing some interest behind the scenes: former Gov. Charlie Crist, who has lost his past two elections — governor in 2012 and Senate in 2010, the latter against Rubio. Crist, who couldn’t be reached, would be far less likely to run for the Senate again if he had to run against an incumbent Rubio.  The same is likely true of Wasserman Schultz, who’s in a safe seat.  Murphy sits in a far more competitive district, though he defeated his Republican opponent handily in 2014.  “It’s not a question of if he loses his seat, but when,” one Democratic consultant said of Murphy. “Make no mistake: He has won two hard races. He knows how to win. He can raise big money. That matters. So it makes sense he’ll run for Senate. And the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] loves the guy.”  Wasserman Schultz has a fraught relationship with some Washington Democrats.  For years, anonymous Democrats in Congress, the DNC and Obama’s election machine have trashed the sometimes-acerbic congresswoman in publications like POLITICO and BuzzFeed.  “Nancy Pelosi views Debbie as a threat,” said one Democratic politician familiar with the dynamics in the U.S. House. “So perhaps they’ll all pitch in together to get her out of the DNC and out of the House and into the Senate where no one can really do anything.”  As DNC chair, Wasserman Schultz has major fundraising responsibilities nationwide. Democrats say she can’t realistically be a statewide Florida candidate — especially in a potentially contested primary — and fully serve the party at the same time. One Democrat said she could make the decision to leave the DNC no later than April.  Unlike many in Obama’s orbit, Wasserman Schultz has the aura of a Clinton-machine Democrat. She was Hillary Clinton’s co-chair for her 2008 race. Some Democrats have accused her of being disloyal to Clinton toward the end of the contest against Obama, but others say the relationship between the two women is strong.  Wasserman Schultz wouldn’t comment on the chatter. “My only focus right now is serving the people of Florida’s 23rd District in Congress and electing the 45th President of the United States,” she said in a statement.  Florida has had only one female U.S. senator, Republican Paula Hawkins, who served from 1981-87.  Some Democrats are salivating at the prospect of a history-making, two-woman top-of-the-ticket race in Florida. They also hope a female Senate candidate would attract unmarried female voters, who tend to vote Democrat but disproportionately avoid voting in Florida midterms along with African-Americans and Hispanics.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 3.6 percentage points in Florida, yet the GOP controls the four statewide elected offices based in Tallahassee, one U.S. Senate seat, a supermajority in the state House and a majority in the state Senate — and that’s despite an anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendment voters approved in 2010.  Presidential election years are much kinder to Florida Democrats: Obama won the state twice, and Sen. Bill Nelson was easily reelected in 2012.  Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz | M. Scott Mahaskey  Wasserman Schultz’s supporters first whispered about her as a possible Senate pick during the 2012 cycle. Many wanted Nelson to run for governor and, if he won, to pick Wasserman Schultz as his replacement an appointment, however, that could have been disputed under Florida law.  The buzz died down as Crist’s candidacy surged, but it’s back now that Democrats believe Rubio is more serious about not seeking reelection if he pursues a White House run. Under state law, Rubio would have to choose which office to pursue.  Follow @politico  Rubio hasn’t completely pledged to not seek reelection if he runs for president. But he has almost shut the door on the possibility.  “If I’m running for president, I’m running for president,” Rubio told POLITICO. “That wouldn’t be my strategy or my thought or my plan. My plan would be to run for president to win.”  Rubio said he has no favored potential successor: “I think we have a deep bench of quality candidates. I’m sure a good one will be our nominee and will win it. I haven’t made that decision. But I anticipate when you are running for president, you have your hands full.”  A number of Republicans want more assurances before they start up plans to run. Among the possible GOP candidates: state CFO Jeff Atwater, former House Speaker Will Weatherford, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and U.S. Reps. Ron DeSantis and Vern Buchanan.  As for the Democrats, aside from Wasserman Schultz, Murphy and Crist, Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine, independently wealthy and a friend of the Clintons, hasn’t tamped down speculation about his potential interest. Nor has U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch of Boca Raton.  Most top Florida Democrats say that Wasserman Schultz would be tough to beat because of her high name recognition and fundraising prowess. Top-tier Florida campaigns cost at least $10 million. Gov. Rick Scott spent the most, about $115 million in 2014, to defeat Crist by just 1.08 percentage points.  Wasserman Schultz’s post at the DNC has both pluses and minuses for a potential Senate candidacy. While she has greatly expanded her fundraising contact list and media profile, she also could be perceived as too much of a liberal partisan in conservative and moderate quarters of Florida.  “I hear from many people she is interested. I think her problem will be the notion of statewide,” Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, an Obama donor, said by email. “She is very safe and popular inside her district but coming out from there will be a problem in my opinion. As chair of the DNC you are the attack dog for the party. It’s your job. You become polarizing.”  Morgan employs Crist in his law firm and said the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat’s pollster, John Anzalone, has indicated that Crist might seek the Senate seat. Anzalone also polled for a medical-marijuana initiative Morgan underwrote in 2014, when it fell about 3 percentage points shy of the needed 60 percent voter-approval threshold for a state constitutional amendment.  Morgan and Wasserman Schultz had a public falling out over medical marijuana when he blasted her as an “irrelevant … irritant” once she echoed conservative criticisms of the initiative.  Medical marijuana isn’t the only surprisingly conservative position for the otherwise liberal congresswoman. For years, Wasserman Schultz has voted with most Republicans and against most Democrats in favor of keeping a hard line against Cuba’s Castro dictatorship. After Obama announced his plan to normalize relations, Wasserman Schultz’s statement was markedly delayed and tepid.  U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson spoke highly of Wasserman Schultz — even though he is eyeing a 2016 Senate bid as well.  “I would not run against Debbie Wasserman Schultz out of respect and admiration for her,” Grayson said in an interview. “She would be almost impossible to beat in a Democratic primary anyway.”  Grayson said he believed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, should he go ahead with a presidential bid in 2016, would have “coattails” for a Republican candidate in Florida, making it all the better to have a ticket led by Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, who bests Bush by inside-the-error-margin amounts in early Florida polls.  Asked if Wasserman Schultz were seriously considering a run, Grayson said “yes.” When asked whether the two had spoken about the matter, Grayson said he wouldn’t disclose private conversations.  The prospect of a Wasserman Schultz-Murphy primary for Senate could pit the two camps of the Florida Democratic Party against each other: Those who argue for a more centrist approach side with Murphy, and those who favor a candidacy that doesn’t shy away from liberalism are more in Wasserman Schultz’s camp.  The potentially open Senate seat puts Florida Democrats like Steve Schale in a tough spot. Schale, a fan of both Murphy and Wasserman Schultz, served as an adviser to Crist and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, who intends to run for reelection to her 2nd District seat.  Schale said some have dismissed the idea of Wasserman Schultz running, but they might be surprised.  “She’s considering [the] Senate far more seriously than many people are giving her credit for,” Schale said.

The Trump campaign is contesting election results in several states due to massive voter fraud and irregularities so Republican Electors are stepping up and casting procedural votes to preserve the legal challenges.  Crooked Secretaries of State in Georgia and Pennsylvania certified false election results in favor of Joe Biden.  Republican Electors in Georgia and Pennsylvania on Monday cast procedural votes for President and Vice President to preserve the Trump campaign’s legal challenges.  Georgia GOP Chairman David Shafer said, “Because the President’s lawsuit contesting the Georgia election is still pending, the Republican nominees for Presidential Elector met today at noon at the State Capitol today and cast their votes for President and Vice President.”  “Had we not meet today and cast our votes, the President’s pending election contest would have been effectively mooted.

5d8daa18,"More Than 10,000 Dead People Cast Ballots in Michigan, Analysis Shows","A worker with the Detroit Department of Elections carries empty boxes used to organize absentee ballots after nearing the end of the absentee ballot count at the Central Counting Board in the TCF Center in Detroit, Mich., on Nov. 4, 2020. Elaine Cromie/Getty Images  More Than 10,000 Dead People Cast Ballots in Michigan, Analysis Shows  More than 10,000 people confirmed or suspected dead have returned their mail-in ballots to vote in Michigan, according to an analysis of the state’s election data.  About 9,500 voters confirmed dead through the Social Security Death Index SSDI are marked in the state’s mail voting database as having returned ballots. Another nearly 2,000 are 100 years old or more and aren’t listed as known living centenarians.  The analysis was provided by Richard Baris, director of Big Data Poll.  The data indicates that somebody else was trying to vote on behalf of these people.  “It’s also entirely possible that some of them aren’t even real people,” Baris told The Epoch Times via email. “If someone is 110 or some ridiculous age, we should have their death record but do not.”  Americans older than 110 are exceedingly rare; only a handful of such seniors are known to live in Michigan.  According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,729 centenarians in Michigan pdf.  Even if somebody tried to vote on behalf of a deceased person, the vote would be rejected, according to Tracy Wimmer, spokeswoman for the Michigan secretary of state.  “Ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan, even if the voter cast an absentee ballot and then died before Election Day,” she previously told The Epoch Times via email.  However, Baris isn’t convinced.  “While I’m open to the idea some of these have been rejected, I’m not open to any outright dismissal they all were rejected,” he said in a Nov. 8 tweet.  The data on how many ballots were rejected isn’t available yet, Wimmer said.  She said that “a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead.”  “This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr., when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr., or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file.”  This only happens “on rare occasions,” she said.  Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads in Michigan by less than 150,000 votes. The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Michigan to halt vote counting until Republican observers are granted adequate access. The GOP-led Michigan legislature is investigating allegations of election irregularities in the state.  In a Nov. 9 lawsuit, a Detroit poll watcher alleged thousands of mail-in ballots from people who weren’t properly registered to vote were added to vote counts.  Poll operators were adding names and addresses to the poll book with made-up birth dates, such as 1/1/1900, he said in a sworn affidavit.  Baris said the mail voting data he worked from likely isn’t up to date enough to capture any irregularities that happened Election Day and after.  “If they did that on Election Day in Michigan, then we likely wouldn’t know until December,” he said. “If it is true, then they’d, unfortunately, get away with it in the short-term.”  President Donald Trump is challenging the results of the elections in several states where Biden holds a tight lead. The Trump campaign is alleging invalid ballots were counted for Democrats, valid ballots were thrown away for Republicans, and Republican ballot watchers were prevented from meaningfully observing the vote-counting process.",false
08bcc604,George Osborne calls on Labour MPs to back welfare changes in Commons vote,"George Osborne has urged progressive MPs in the Labour party to back his welfare changes in a critical Commons vote on Monday night, saying they should recognise that the proposals not only chime with the public but build on mainstream Labour thinking.  Writing in the Guardian, the chancellor calls on Labour to stop blaming the public for its defeat and recognise that welfare requires public consent.  Labour has plunged into a deep, week-long split over how to respond to Osborne’s welfare plans, with at least three of the leadership candidates, including Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper, rejecting the interim Labour leader Harriet Harman’s plea for the party to abstain and back a lower welfare cap. Harman also said Labour should not oppose the restriction of tax credits to a claimant’s first two children.  She said the party needed to recognise that the electorate had sent Labour a message on welfare and it had to show it was listening. But she has now been forced into a partial retreat, and the party has instead tabled an amendment rejecting the bill. Some Labour MPs still believe the new compromise does not go far enough and will vote against the bill on Monday, not just support a dissenting amendment.  Osborne sprung a surprise in the budget by proposing cuts to the level of tax credits, but balanced these in part by a rise in the minimum wage to more than £9 an hour by 2020 for those over 25. Osborne argues that the responsibility for ensuring decent living standards should be rebalanced from the state handing out subsidies towards employers providing decent wages.  He writes: “Three in four people – and a majority of Labour voters – think that Britain spends too much on welfare. For our social contract to work, we need to retain the consent of the taxpayer, not just the welfare recipient. For those that can work, I believe it is better to earn a higher income from your work than receive a higher income from welfare.  “I thought British politics had taken a step forward when Labour’s acting leader Harriet Harman indicated that she would support at least some of our reforms. She recognised that oppositions only advance when they stop blaming the public for their defeat and recognise that some of the arguments made by political opponents should be listened to – just as a previous Conservative opposition realised 15 years ago when it accepted the case for a minimum wage.  “Depressingly, the Labour leader has been forced to retreat from her sensible position after Len McCluskey accused her of ‘running up the white flag’ and leadership candidates Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper joined Jeremy Corbyn in undermining her. With the vote coming on Monday, I urge moderate Labour MPs not to make the same mistake as in the last parliament, when they refused to support each and every welfare reform we proposed. I say: vote with us.”  Helen Goodman MP, who tabled an amendment to block the welfare bill without consent from the party’s leadership, told the Today programme on Monday that she hoped the Labour leadership hopefuls would vote against the bill if Harman’s motion didn’t succeed.  “Having pointed out what’s wrong with the bill it seems to me only logical, if her motion doesn’t succeed ... that we vote against the bill in its entirety.”  Goodman rejected Osborne’s claim that Labour voters had supported the government’s proposed welfare cuts.    “I don’t think George Osborne is quite right about this,” she said. “Throughout the election campaign the Tories refused to say where their £12bn worth of cuts were going to come from. They did that precisely because they had these ideas in the back of their mind and they knew they would be deeply unpopular with the British people, and that they would lose votes if they revealed them.”  Osborne insisted his stance represented the new centre ground of politics and called on progressive MPs to join the Conservatives in the lobby.    He said: “Because we’re requiring all employers by law to pay the national living wage, we can rein in the tax credit system that has subsidised low wages for too long.”  The proposals are part of a common endeavour by Labour and the Conservatives to implement difficult welfare reforms, he says.  Osborne adds: “To their credit, New Labour work and pensions secretaries such as John Hutton, David Blunkett and James Purnell all tried to reform the welfare system. Now Alistair Darling says tax credits are ‘subsidising lower wages in a way that was never intended’. And Frank Field, elected by all MPs to be the new chair of the work and pensions committee, agrees the system as it stands is simply ‘not sustainable’ and the budget represents a ‘game-changer’. That’s because, working closely with my colleague Iain Duncan Smith, those long-held aspirations for genuine welfare reform are being delivered.”  He points out that Blunkett had described the previous welfare system as “crackers”. The tax credit system had become unsustainable, Osborne said, adding: “It can’t be right that a tax credits system Gordon Brown said would cost just over £1bn in its first year ended up costing £30bn, with payments being made to nine in every 10 families with children.”  Osborne’s warning to Labour not to forget the principle of taxpayer consent came as the party’s leadership candidates continued to scrap over how to respond to the welfare changes.  Speaking on the BBC’s Sunday Politics, which hosted a debate between the candidates, Burnham explained why he led the revolt over Harman’s plan not to oppose the government’s welfare bill: “I believe tax credits are one of the biggest and best things we did, because they support people in work and get people into work. The problem with George Osborne’s budget is it diminished those work incentives and it isn’t going to do what he claims he is doing.”  Liz Kendall, who has been described as the Blairite candidate, challenged Burnham and Cooper to explain how their stance on welfare differed from the one that helped Labour lose the election.  Burnham said he supported the principle of a benefits cap, and Cooper said she backed a universal childcare system. She said: “That’s what we should be doing. That would help far more people into work.”  The Labour manifesto had contained backing for a welfare cap, but plans for a universal childcare system were blocked by Ed Miliband largely on grounds of cost.  Kendall said: “I don’t want to see child tax credits cut from poor and low-paid families. But I thought that Harriet Harman was right to say to us as a party that we’ve lost the election and one of the big reasons why was people didn’t trust us on welfare. And if we keep saying and doing the things we’ve done over the past five years over the next five years, we will get the same result. So I want to support and back Harriet for raising a very difficult issue for us as a party.”",partially false
fba6d4c5,Reasons why the 2020 presidential election is deeply puzzling,"To say out-loud that you find the results of the 2020 presidential election odd is to invite derision. You must be a crank or a conspiracy theorist. Mark me down as a crank, then. I am a pollster and I find this election to be deeply puzzling. I also think that the Trump campaign is still well within its rights to contest the tabulations. Something very strange happened in America’s democracy in the early hours of Wednesday November 4 and the days that followed. It’s reasonable for a lot of Americans to want to find out exactly what.  First, consider some facts. President Trump received more votes than any previous incumbent seeking reelection. He got 11 million more votes than in 2016, the third largest rise in support ever for an incumbent. By way of comparison, President Obama was comfortably reelected in 2012 with 3.5 million fewer votes than he received in 2008.  Trump’s vote increased so much because, according to exit polls, he performed far better with many key demographic groups. Ninety-five percent of Republicans voted for him. He did extraordinarily well with rural male working-class whites.  Trump grew his support among black voters by 50 percent over 2016. Nationally, Joe Biden’s black support fell well below 90 percent, the level below which Democratic presidential candidates usually lose.  Trump increased his share of the national Hispanic vote to 35 percent. With 60 percent or less of the national Hispanic vote, it is arithmetically impossible for a Democratic presidential candidate to win Florida, Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico. Bellwether states swung further in Trump’s direction than in 2016. Florida, Ohio and Iowa each defied America’s media polls with huge wins for Trump. Since 1852, only Richard Nixon has lost the Electoral College after winning this trio, and that 1960 defeat to John F. Kennedy is still the subject of great suspicion.  Midwestern states Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin always swing in the same direction as Ohio and Iowa, their regional peers. Ohio likewise swings with Florida. Current tallies show that, outside of a few cities, the Rust Belt swung in Trump’s direction. Yet, Biden leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin because of an apparent avalanche of black votes in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Milwaukee. Biden’s ‘winning’ margin was derived almost entirely from such voters in these cities, as coincidentally his black vote spiked only in exactly the locations necessary to secure victory. He did not receive comparable levels of support among comparable demographic groups in comparable states, which is highly unusual for the presidential victor.  We are told that Biden won more votes nationally than any presidential candidate in history. But he won a record low of 17 percent of counties; he only won 524 counties, as opposed to the 873 counties Obama won in 2008. Yet, Biden somehow outdid Obama in total votes.  Victorious presidential candidates, especially challengers, usually have down-ballot coattails; Biden did not. The Republicans held the Senate and enjoyed a ‘red wave’ in the House, where they gained a large number of seats while winning all 27 toss-up contests. Trump’s party did not lose a single state legislature and actually made gains at the state level.  Another anomaly is found in the comparison between the polls and non-polling metrics. The latter include: party registrations trends; the candidates’ respective primary votes; candidate enthusiasm; social media followings; broadcast and digital media ratings; online searches; the number of especially small donors; and the number of individuals betting on each candidate.  Despite poor recent performances, media and academic polls have an impressive 80 percent record predicting the winner during the modern era. But, when the polls err, non-polling metrics do not; the latter have a 100 percent record. Every non-polling metric forecast Trump’s reelection. For Trump to lose this election, the mainstream polls needed to be correct, which they were not. Furthermore, for Trump to lose, not only did one or more of these metrics have to be wrong for the first time ever, but every single one had to be wrong, and at the very same time; not an impossible outcome, but extremely unlikely nonetheless.  Atypical voting patterns married with misses by polling and non-polling metrics should give observers pause for thought. Adding to the mystery is a cascade of information about the bizarre manner in which so many ballots were accumulated and counted.  The following peculiarities also lack compelling explanations:  1. Late on election night, with Trump comfortably ahead, many swing states stopped counting ballots. In most cases, observers were removed from the counting facilities. Counting generally continued without the observers  2. Statistically abnormal vote counts were the new normal when counting resumed. They were unusually large in size hundreds of thousands and had an unusually high 90 percent and above Biden-to-Trump ratio  3. Late arriving ballots were counted. In Pennsylvania, 23,000 absentee ballots have impossible postal return dates and another 86,000 have such extraordinary return dates they raise serious questions  4. The failure to match signatures on mail-in ballots. The destruction of mail-in ballot envelopes, which must contain signatures  5. Historically low absentee ballot rejection rates despite the massive expansion of mail voting. Such is Biden’s narrow margin that, as political analyst Robert Barnes observes, ‘If the states simply imposed the same absentee ballot rejection rate as recent cycles, then Trump wins the election’  6. Missing votes. In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, 50,000 votes held on 47 USB cards are missing  7. Non-resident voters. Matt Braynard’s Voter Integrity Project estimates that 20,312 people who no longer met residency requirements cast ballots in Georgia. Biden’s margin is 12,670 votes",other
4178b9b4,Democrats Tried to Slip a Law Banning Pledge of Allegiance Into Aid Package,"In stunning new findings released by the Dunning-Kruger Institute, Democrats were found to have added provisions to ban the Pledge of Allegiance, into the emergency aid package. The language, added by Pelosi and Schumer, was very clear of its intention:  “The passing of this legislative package will also outlaw the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in all schools in the United States. This statute will go into effect immediately upon this bill’s passage. Anyone found guilty of reciting the Pledge will be charged with grand heresy, and punished by up to 10 years in a federal penitentiary and a fine of no less than $20,000.”  Republicans Senator Joe Barron slammed the news:  “Democrats bad, Republicans good. It’s really that simple. Everything is simple like that in life.”  The Democrats thought they were sneaky, adding this nonsense into the aid bill. The Republicans were too smart, however, and the foolish Democrat plot was foiled. Republicans are a party of literacy and read they did. They read the bill in its entirety to check for traps like this laid by the Democrats.  It’s also a sad state of affairs that the Democrats would use such a bill, one for emergency relief, to push their leftist communist agenda. Can’t they just stop playing politics for one day and pass a bill for the American people? I guess not. They will never change. They need to be removed and replaced with Republicans that represent the people.",false

That was somewhat to be expected, but no details have yet been given except for one very significant one announced by Kamala Harris today.  Harris made an announcement before some group in Chicago:  “The United States government cannot continue to pay for the every need of what has become a special class of citizen. Veterans are equal to us, not better than. Veterans Affairs coddles them. It creates a dependency upon us which is not doing these former soldiers any good. They need to learn to live on their own two feet and be responsible adults. The easiest way to assist them on this journey is to cut them off. Within these next four years, we will be shuttering the VA, taking away soldier welfare. The money saved will go to better use in assisting refugee families. These poor folks seek asylum with us and need a boost and it is our responsibility as a nation to provide it. So here’s a message to the soldier boys. Get a job.”  This woman has a lot of nerve speaking to our brave military personnel in that way. These men and women sacrificed themselves for this country. Harris has never even come close to doing such a thing.",false
47c19c92,County Officials In Pennsylvania Hit With 2020 Voting Lawsuit *Correction Issued,"County Officials In Pennsylvania Hit With 2020 Voting Lawsuit *Correction Issued  Correction Issued:  The previous headline for this article Swing State Hit With 2020 Voting Lawsuit – Accused Of Registering Over 1,500 Deceased People In Pennsylvania incorrectly states that the swing state Pennsylvania was sued. This is incorrect as only county officials in Allegheny are being sued. In addition, the headline states that they are accused of registering over 1,500 deceased people. This is also incorrect as they weren’t personally responsible for registering the dead people on the active voter list. They are being sued for not doing enough to remove deceased voters who were already on the roll. This is very important context and warranted a full correction issued for the article.  We apologize for mischaracterizing important parts of the story as we strive to publish 100% accurate reporting at all times. We will do better in the future to verify claims from source material before publishing onto our site. Thank you to all of our readers who continue to support us each day.  -Patriot Journal team  Original story:  We’ve heard of many voting and election problems in recent years.  It’s an issue that extends far and wide, too; it isn’t only limited to certain areas.  For instance, it seems another major voting snafu has popped up in a Pennsylvania county … where it seems ghosts can participate in elections.  That’s right – a LOT of dead individuals are actually registered to vote!  As a result, a lawsuit has been filed against the county for its failure to clean up their voter rolls.  Maybe this legal action is just what we need to clean things up!  From Breitbart:  A lawsuit filed against Allegheny County, Pennsylvania alleges that nearly 1,600 dead people are registered to vote in the 2020 election in the county.  Nearly 1,600 people – who have long since passed on – are still on the voter rolls. How ridiculous is that?  The Public Interest Legal Foundation filed the suit, and found that 1,583 deceased registrants remain active voters.  Come on. Seriously? They can’t even keep voter lists updated?  Did you know that nearly 50 of those people have birth dates in the 1800s?! I mean, that’s just pathetic.  But wait, there’s more…  In addition, the lawsuit also claims that nearly 7,500 voter registrations are duplicates!  In one extreme case, the person registered to vote SEVEN TIMES in on day while out of state.  This is just plain unacceptable. If this is indicative of the current state of our voting system, we’re in big trouble.  If we get to November and these voting problems still exist, we could be looking at some major issues…  I think it’s high time that we start cleaning things up across the country! Don’t you agree?

0a12bd0d,Pittsburgh Steelers Will Fine ANY Player Kneeling For The Anthem $1 Million,"The NFL has decided to roll back its rule against players kneeling during the national anthem, but that doesn’t mean the teams have to comply. According to our source inside the Steelers’ organization, the management has made it clear that they won’t stand for kneeling.  Vice President of Football Operations, Art Tubolls, says the decision was an easy one to make:  “It’s simple, really. We want our Western Pennsylvanian hicks to be happy. This is largely a Trump-supporting town of pseudo-patriots, and we need to make sure they don’t go boycotting the team. So, while we don’t like ignoring the fact that these are perfectly legitimate protests, we also don’t like losing money. So players and coaches alike will do as they’re told or pay a steep price.”  Tubolls says the fines will also extend to visiting teams, and that if they don’t like it, they’re welcome to sit in the locker room during the anthem where nobody can see them expressing their opinions. “There is no opinion. Our fans are pretty racist. We’re not willing to piss them off. They only like black people when they score touchdowns.”  Tubolls also said that there will be a bonus at the end of the season for players who stood with hand on heart for the camera. “It’s a performance bonus, really. The white players have it rough, having to appear as though they care about veterans and their black teammates, so they’ll get a gift certificate to the local Mercedes dealer. The black players will have first dibs on the Popeye’s chicken sandwiches at the team picnic next spring.”  It seems like the Steelers have a good handle on this thing. They’re dealing with it just like you’d expect a cog in the American capitalist machine to. The entire league should take notes. Great job, Steelers.",false

Today Tue., the US Navy is positioning Aircraft carriers and their strike groups off both the US east and west coasts. It appears we are preparing to defend ourselves from an invasion. China?  Late Saturday, no fewer than 25 C-17 aircraft were in the skies over the USA, carrying troops and equipment from around the nation . . . ALL going to Nellis Air Force Base. Story Here.  Also late Saturday, no fewer than 12 C-130 aircraft were also on the move, ALSO ALL heading into Nellis.  MAP  On Sunday, locals on and around Nellis reported the base was swarming with soldiers and Marines. They also reported seeing a vast array of land fighting vehicles coming out of cargo aircraft. Article continues beneath Ad  Ad  NAVAL DEPLOYMENTS  This morning, according the the US Naval Institute, the Navy has deployed THREE 3 Aircraft Carriers, plus a Landing Helicopter Dock LHD off the US West Coast, and TWO 2 Aircraft carriers and their Strike Groups plus another LHD off the US East Coast.  Off the West Coast is the USS Carl Vinson in the Pacific NOT AT PORT along the Oregon/Washington Border,  the USS Essex LHD off the coast of San Francisco,  and the USS Theodore Roosevelt and its Strike Group off the coast of Los Angeles . . .  Off the East Coast are the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower off the Coast of Connecticut,  the USS Gerald R. Ford off the coast of New Jersey,  and the USS Iwo Jima off the coast of South Carolina . . .  The map below lays out the approximate location of the vessels:  Given these new naval deployments, and the very large, sudden, movement of troops into Nellis AFB, one gets the impression that the United States is preparing to defend its homeland from actual invasion.  Hint: That may actually be the case.  Word in Intelligence circles says that if the Supreme Court voids any or all of the November 3 election due to the massive fraud and violations of the US Constitution with changes to election laws, the lawless extension of voting for weeks, in violation of 3 USC 1 & 2, the Democrats are planning on asking the United Nations to INVADE to depose Trump as a Dictator. There is also word within Intelligence circles that the states of California, Oregon, and Washington, plus New York, might actually try to secede from the Union if Trump gets four more years, and may need to be forcibly brought back under US control, the same way renegade southern states were handled back in the 1860's Civil War. HT Note: It would gladden my heart to see the US military bombing egomaniac Governor Andrew Cuomo and filthy Commie NYC Mayor Bill DeBlasio back into the Union . . . or to Kingdom come . . .  China and Russia are deploying their naval assets in such a way that transit to the US would not take long!  China is positioning out in the Pacific.  Just this morning, the British revealed they have been tracking the entire Russian Northern Fleet off the British Coast this month, as the Russians head out into the North Atlantic for . . . . something. Story HERE  One possibility is they are heading toward the Mediterranean to deal with Syria and perhaps Turkey. But what if they're **NOT** going into the Mediterranean? What if they're positioning out in the Atlantic to arrive as requested along the US East Coast?  It sounds corny, but we won't know until we know and that will be a few days.  Stay tuned folks. We're seeing history unfolding.  As a precaution, we remind you that your firearms need cleaning and oiling; especially if you haven't used them in awhile. They collect dust, develop surface rust in the barrel. Now might be a good time to take them out, clean them, oil them, and make sure they are in pristine condition. Don't want any jamming or misfires if we suddenly find ourselves having to shoot and kill invading foreign troops, invited here by Traitors . . . who would also have to be shot and killed.

8172bb79,City Council should pass human-rights ordinance,"I know firsthand what it's like to experience discrimination simply because of who you are. Fifty years ago, I was a little girl who got scolded by a teacher for speaking Spanish during recess. I also know that those sentiments are not indicative of who we are as San Antonians.  That's why I'm hopeful the San Antonio City Council will pass updates to the city code ensuring that the city, and those who contract with the city, will not discriminate against their employees because of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or veterans' status. These common-sense updates also ensure fair treatment in housing and public accommodations and will bring San Antonio in line with the codes of cities such as Dallas, Fort Worth, and Austin. But, they'll also make sure our city's laws reflect our city's values.  I was fortunate, in an age when women weren't always allowed the same opportunities as men, to have parents who convinced me that I could do anything. As an educator, my mother pushed me academically. And, whenever people would comment to my father that I was pretty, he would reply, “She's the smartest in her class.” These are values our city should promote — ensuring equal access to opportunities based on dedication and talent, not on who we love or who we are.  With respect to those who have come before us, we know that change is constant. The image of Texas is of cowboys — vaqueros — fighting to tame a wild frontier. But now we have a 21st century powerhouse economy. Our small-town past steadily changed into a high-rise present — and today, six of the 20 largest cities in the United States are right here in Texas.  We'll continue to change — I believe for the better. I can't think of any better time in history to be living in Texas than right now. Texans have always boasted that this is a land of opportunity, and this has never been truer than today.  As chairwoman of the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, I was blessed to meet Staff Sergeant Eric Alva. In 2003, this San Antonio native became the first Marine to be seriously injured in the Iraq War, when he stepped on a land mine and lost his right leg.  He fought for us. He fought for you. He very nearly died for our country, and still suffers for it every day. And yet, here in his home state and his home city, he can be denied or fired from a job just because he is gay. It's not right that a man who fought to protect this country is not protected at home — that a man who loves his country is discriminated against because of who he loves.  Updating the city's non-discrimination ordinance acknowledges the importance of ensuring that all members of our community are treated with fairness and dignity. Together we can make this possible, together we will erase harmful inequalities that threaten our city's quality of life.  Thankfully, I will not have to stand alone, because San Antonians are with us. We all know and respect people like Eric.",partially false
6c5d1fe3,"Thousands of Ballots Found Floating In The Lake In Erie, Pennsylvania","Federal election officials from the USA Department of Justice have swarmed to Erie, Pennsylvania, where a trash bag full of ballots has reportedly appeared floating just offshore.  Lead election investigator, Joe Barron, says the find could have been one of the most significant towards proving Trump’s election fraud claims had it worked out.  Sadly, what they recovered was so damaged by the water that there was no way to determine what was in the bag without a full forensic analysis, which was performed by the FBI.  According to that report, the contents of the bag were most definitely ballots, but the hard part of the investigation was just beginning:  “The bag contained more than 3000 ballots. That we know for sure. What we don’t know is who cast them or whether they would change the outcome of the election. “There’s a lot more work to do.”  The Department of Homeland Security has taken custody of the ballots and the US Marshals are keeping watch over them. A high-ranking official inside the Treasury Department says he’s not sure what all the fuss is about:  “Yeah, the problem is, they aren’t being very honest about the whole thing. The bag is full of ballots, sure, but they’re ballots for last season’s finale of The Voice. We’re pretty sure that show has never actually had a real winner, so…why all the hubbub? “It’s pretty silly, really.”  President Trump released a statement declaring the entire election in Pennsylvania a wash and laid claim to the 20 electoral votes, as is his right under an executive he signed a few minutes earlier.  “President Trump says the message is clear,” said a pal, “if you can alter something as secure as an election on a popular TV show, then the whole system is in question. This never would have happened on Celebrity Apprentice.”  We’ll keep you updated on this ridiculously irrelevant story.",false
244152ed,Kamala Harris On Hot Mic: ‘Trump Voters Are Idiots’,"Kamala Harris was caught on a hot mic during an interview trashing patriotic Trump voters — the backbone of this great country!  Her exact words:  “These people are idiots. They know nothing except for bumper sticker slogans and they’re pretty gross too.”  These are words from the Vice Presidential candidate of the United States of America. Our president or Vice President would never even think to say such things.  The statement was made during a speech during a Black Lives Matter protest, where she was to address the crowd. Conservatives who happened to be in the crowd for a counter-protest were horrified and disgusted by what she said.  They said she pretty much gave them the stink eye as well, completely denigrating them as they were nothing.  “It was unbelievable!” said patriot Sandy Batt, who was in the crowd. “She said it, I don’t think she realized it, but if she did, she just shooed us off!”  Batt exclaimed, just shocked and in disbelief at what she had just heard.  “It’s like she’s calling us stupid!”  Mind you Ms. Batt’s sign was full of grammatical errors and she was waving a Gadsden Flag and a Thin Blue Line flag, apparently not realizing they cancel each other out.  Another attendee, Joe Barron, couldn’t stop laughing at the counter-protesters when he saw the shock grow across their stupid faces.  “Well, Trump did say he loves the poorly educated, these people should be embracing their proud stupidity!”  Other Trump supporters just looked confused and dumbfounded, pretty much like they usually do.  Why anyone would be even the littlest bit offended by this is beyond me. Trump has been saying pretty vile things since he first ran for president in 2015.  The clutching pearls crowd will be just fine, as they are poorly educated and hate anything that makes them look bad, except for themselves. Oh the irony. God bless America and Donald Trump.",false
7e8aedbe,Mississippi man who was legally sold to Circus as a baby ‘still owned by company’ says court judge,"A Mississippi man who was sold to a traveling circus at the age of three in 1993 by his mother has been ordered by the court to pay back the sum of $1,2 million dollars before he can get his freedom back.  Jared Arnold, 28, was sold in 1993 to the owner of Circus Magicus, Todd Bentley, by his mother Tamara Lee Arnold.  The contract specified at the time that M. Bentley took legal ownership of Jared until his 21st birthday, after which he would have to pay all expenses for which Circus Magicus had taken care of and thus would be set free from his contract.  “He just has to repay what he cost us for the first 21 years of his life and he’s free to go” Circus Magicus owner, Todd Bentley told reporters.  “I understand my mother had addiction problems at the time and M. Bentley possibly saved my life, but at a wage of 9 dollars an hour, I’ll be shoveling elephant shit for the next 53 years if I have to repay this debt,” Arnold said in court.  Jared Arnold first recalled the many jobs he had during his 20 years with the circus, of which he left five years ago at the age of 23.  “I first dressed up as a midget, then I learned to juggle with fire and explosives before I burned myself and eventually became an acrobat. A back injury left me paralyzed when I fell from 30 feet high up in the air and these are the hospital bills I am still paying today,” he explained in court.  A number of injuries led Jared’s adoptive father, Todd Bentley, to pay for over $585,769 in hospital fees over the past eight years.  Judge Andrew Neil told Arnold that the contract was clear and legal according to Mississippi laws at the time and that “it was only fair” that he would pay back his hospital bills and living fees since M. Bentley was not his biological father and agreed, upon certain terms, to take full responsibility for the young infant at the time.  Judge Neil also allowed the defendant to keep his job as a Starbucks barista, where he presently works, to pay off his debt towards Circus Magicus explaining that as long as he paid back his debt he could work “wherever he wanted.”  Arnold’s lawyer pleaded the judge to reduce his client’s debt, claiming that at his current wage it would take the defendant over 28 years to pay back his debt but the demand was swiftly denied by the judge.",false

6612a10d,Deliveroo drivers demand union recognition and minimum wage after Uber workers’ rights ruling,"Deliveroo couriers have demanded union recognition and employment rights and are set to take legal action if the company rejects their request.  The news comes after a landmark ruling in October stated Uber drivers are employees, not self-employed as the company had claimed. The judgment could entitle thousands of “gig economy” workers to holiday pay and a guaranteed minimum wage.  The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain IWGB has demanded recognition from Deliveroo so that the union can bargain for pay and conditions on workers’ behalf. The deal will initially cover Camden in north London and will be rolled out nationwide if successful.  Recommended Read more Uber ordered to pay drivers minimum wage in landmark case  If half of drivers in the area sign up, Deliveroo will be forced to recognise the union. It will be the first collective bargaining agreement in the “gig economy”, setting a precedent for others to demand further rights.  Deliveroo has 10 business days to respond, after which an application will be submitted to the Central Arbitration Committee CAC asking it to force Deliveroo into collective bargaining.  IWGB general secretary Jason Moyer-Lee said: “Of course, for the CAC to entertain our request they will need to decide that Deliveroo drivers are ‘workers’ and not the ‘independent contractors’ you have bogusly deemed them to be,” Moyer-Lee said.  “Deliveroo drivers work for Deliveroo and as such they should be entitled to paid holiday, minimum wage, trade union rights, and all the other rights associated with worker status.”  Please enter your email address Please enter a valid email address Please enter a valid email address SIGN UP Thanks for signing up to the News newsletter {{#verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} {{^verifyErrors}} {{message}} {{/verifyErrors}} I would like to be emailed about offers, events and updates from The Independent.

Read our privacy notice  Experts said the case could be hugely significant. Aaron Hayward, employment specialist at DJM Solicitors said it was “no surprise” the drivers were taking action after the Uber case.“The explosion of the gig economy means many thousands of workers across the UK are now engaged in temporary, casual work that doesn’t entitle them to paid holiday, minimum wage and other rights, because they are officially classified as ‘contractors’,” he said.  If the drivers are successful, Deliveroo will be the “first app-based employer to recognise a union in the UK. First they must succeed in convincing a tribunal that drivers should be reclassified as employees as opposed to contractors as collective bargaining laws only apply to employees.  “This is an employment case that employers, workers and lawyers alike will be watching with interest. As we move more towards a ‘gig economy’ based on short-term, software-driven casual work, this issue isn’t going to away anytime soon.”  Deliveroo delivers food from thousands of restaurants which do not have their own delivery service such as Pizza Express, Byron and Gourmet Burger Kitchen.  Drivers receive £3.75 per delivery under a new pilot scheme, but some have allege they wait up to an hour for a delivery, meaning their take-home pay is less than minimum wage. This is legal if the workers are self-employed, but many say it amounts to exploitation.

203e3285,Florida hospital reports a coronavirus ‘infestation’ with multiple confirmed patients,"UPDATE 9:45P ET » Florida Gov. DeSantis confirms coronavirus outbreak in state.  A Sarasota hospital has “activated all protocols for handling potential COVID-19 cases,” it said in a letter to its patients and staff. The letter, obtained by Your Content, is dated March 1, 2020 and confirms the hospital is now on red alert following a CDC notification that a patient has tested positive in their building.  According to a source who was briefed on the entire situation, a total at least three but possibly as many as 8 individuals have been exposed. However, that figure does not include individuals that might’ve contracted the virus prior to the patient’s initial arrival, the source says.  “We’ve been asked to stay silent on the issue until the CDC has time to assess the damages,” the source said, speaking only under the condition of anonymity.  Tomorrow I will be in Tampa and Miami with Surgeon General Rivkees and other officials to discuss our continued statewide response on #COVID19. https://t.co/sMrWkQlyoi — Ron DeSantis @GovRonDeSantis March 2, 2020  “I could confirm there are at least three individuals being placed under extreme care — one remains in isolation and has tested positive for the coronavirus.”  The source noted they are awaiting the results from approximately 8 tests that were subsequently sent out after the patient tested positive.  “Doctors Hospital of Sarosota has been notified by the Centers for Disease Control that we have a patient in our facility who presumptively tested positive for COVID-19,” the release reads. “This patient was admitted to our facility in late February, and remains in our care. On Friday, Feb. 28th, the CDC changed its guidance regarding COVID-19, specifically, the criteria for persons under investigation PUI, which consequently activated all protocols for handling potential COVID-19 cases, including immediate isolation.”  📸: Doctors Hospital of Sarasota Patient for Your Content  “All potentially exposed individuals have been identified. We are working very closely with the local and state departments of health as well as the CDC to assure that we continue to take all appropriate precautions,” the release goes on to say.  Florida has 2 presumptive positive #COVID19 cases: one adult resident of Hillsborough County and one adult resident of Manatee County. Both individuals are isolated and being appropriately cared for. — Florida Dept. Health @HealthyFla March 2, 2020  “Just as we have done with seasonal flu and tuberculosis, we identify and treat infectious diseases while minimizing risk. By being aware of the very latest recommendations of the CDC, Doctors Hospital of Sarosota was able to identify this patient and pursue testing at the very earliest opportunity.”  “Please know that the safety of our patients, colleagues and community is of the utmost concern,” the release declares.  The recent widespread outbreak of the respiratory disease stemmed from a novel coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in 60 locations internationally, including in the United States.  Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats, and bats.  During the week of February 23, CDC reported community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 in California in two places, Oregon and Washington. Community spread in Washington resulted in the first death in the United States from COVID-19, as well as the first reported case of COVID-19 in a health care worker, and the first potential outbreak in a long-term care facility.  The CDC affirms that there are ongoing investigations to learn more. This is a rapidly evolving situation and information will be updated as it becomes available.  How will the coronavirus impact my community?  More cases of the coronavirus are likely to be identified in the coming days, according to the CDC. That includes a rapid increase in cases in the United States. It’s also likely that person-to-person spread will continue to occur, including in communities in the United States. It’s likely that at some point, widespread transmission of the coronavirus in the United States will occur.  Widespread transmission of the coronavirus would translate into large numbers of people needing medical care at the same time. Schools, childcare centers, workplaces, and other places for mass gatherings may experience more absenteeism. Public health and healthcare systems may become overloaded, with elevated rates of hospitalizations and deaths. Other critical infrastructure, such as law enforcement, emergency medical services, and transportation industry may also be affected. Health care providers and hospitals may be overwhelmed. At this time, there is no vaccine to protect against the coronavirus and no medications approved to treat it. Nonpharmaceutical interventions would be the most important response strategy.

1fc5ec81,‘Oldies Will Have To Die’ Tweets Trump,"Washington DC – A besieged President Trump justified the administration’s attempt to squelch the Centers for Disease Control CDC guidelines for reopening the country by tweeting “…that’s the price we have to pay. Some oldies will have to die.”  American shops want to open! Hair needs cutting. Demokraps don’t want to bite the bullet but that’s the price we have to pay. Some oldies will have to die. We’re in God’s hands, folks! Liberate America!  Trump Hides CDC Information  The tweet is in response to the all too true story of how the Trump administration attempted to bury guidance on reopening the country for business.  The Associated Press reports.  The Trump administration shelved a document created by the nation’s top disease investigators with step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen restaurants and other public places during the still-raging coronavirus outbreak. The 17-page report by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team, titled “Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,” was researched and written to help faith leaders, business owners, educators and state and local officials as they begin to reopen. It was supposed to be published last Friday, but agency scientists were told the guidance “would never see the light of day,” according to a CDC official. The official was not authorized to talk to reporters and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.  The Future  The public is responding to the story in predictable fashion.

8400483c,BREAKING EXCLUSIVE: Ballots In Arizona’s Maricopa County Found Shredded and In Dumpster – Days Before Senate Audit To Begin,"Piles of shredded ballots were located today in a dumpster in Maricopa County Arizona. This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.  For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors MCBOS agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission EAC. However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:  The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:  TRENDING: BREAKING: Supreme Court Dismisses President Trump and Attorney Lin Wood's Final Election Challenge Without Comment  This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were so no fraud would be identified. The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.  And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:  This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.  The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditors to perform their audit. As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.  Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.  Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.  Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.  We do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.  This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election. This also occurred in Georgia, another state where Biden won by a very slim margin.  What a mess. The corrupt FBI won’t investigate obvious crimes. The corrupt media won’t report them. The communist-leaning Democrats cover them up.",false

930d0381,Delta Force Raids Biden Compound in Ukraine,"During the predawn hours on New Year’s Day, Delta Force operators infiltrated a Biden-controlled stronghold in southeast Ukraine near the port city of Mariupol, according to an anonymous White House Source who said President Trump greenlit the operation following a series of telephone calls to US military commanders and to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.  A Delta detachment, known as 1-SFOD in the Special Operations community, flew from Okinawa Japan to the US Embassy in Kyiv and held position there until Trump cleared the incursion with his Ukrainian counterparts.  Reliable sources said the Trump administration had obtained “credible evidence�? that the Biden family, by proxy, owned a 200-acre estate and office building 50km northwest of Mariupol. On paper the property was owned by Paradigm Global Advisors, a hedge fund firm in which the Bidens have controlling interest. In the late summer of 2006 Joe Biden’s son Hunter and Joe’s younger brother, James, bought the firm. On the first day on the job, they showed up with Biden’s other son, Beau, and three large men and fired Paradigm’s president and 95% of staff, according to a Paradigm executive who was present. After that, much of Paradigm’s overseas ventures went dark but continued to rake in hefty profits despite a conspicuous lack of investors.  In June 2009 Washington Free Beacon writer Thomas Breslin opined the following statement: “Paradigm is hardly a reputable company. The Bidens fired everyone and put their own people in place. The company became nothing less than a slush fund for illicit monies that the Bidens laundered through the place.�?  The Trump administration has spent four years ferreting out the truth behind Paradigm Global Advisors, according to our White House informant.  “After years of digging, Trump finally caught a break. A current Paradigm employee—someone the Biden’s fucked over—came forward with enough evidence for Trump to make this move. I don’t know what specific evidence was presented, but it must have been some heavy-hitting stuff for Trump to call on Delta to take care of it.�?  At 3am on New Year’s Day, three Blackhawk helicopters, including decoy aircraft, airlifted Delta from Kyiv to the drop zone. The team found the office building empty, devoid of life. The unit commander described the building as “frigid,�? as if it had been vacant and without heat for a long time.  “The windows were covered in a hoarfrost glaze, and the place had a catacomb chill about it,�? he was quoted as saying. “Every office had been stripped—no chairs, no desks, no computers, no nothing. No electricity.�?  Although the building was long deserted, Delta found evidence of recent activity within the hacienda attached to the compound. In a kitchen were freshly chopped vegetables and a percolator of lukewarm coffee. Outside, fresh tire impressions led away from the compound. It was as if someone had tipped off the occupants.  But in the hacienda Delta hit paydirt. They seized several laptops and 300 million dollars in gold bullion. They also found crates of Chinese-manufactured Type 56 assault rifles and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition. Even more disturbing, they found beneath the hacienda a maze of chambers and tunnels that ran for miles in every direction. Ankle and wrist shackles, bolted to the walls in various locations, held bits of necrotic flesh, and in an antechamber, they discovered twelve duffel bags filled with black tar heroin.  On Trump’s order, Delta coordinated with Ukraine’s SBU, that nation’s security agency in counterintelligence and combatting terrorism, to confiscate evidence and await the arrival of State Department personnel.

4304b695,Marine Corps. Rebukes Pelosi: “WE DON’T WORK FOR YOU!”,"Latest Breaking News: Martial Law Imminent General David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists. A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night. Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office. Her statement made the general explode, our source said. “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said. Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress. “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi. Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.” Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.” Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order. “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that. If he orders me to, I will. Otherwise, I suggest you listen really hard to the words escaping your cracked, poisonous lips; they’re tantamount to treason. We don’t work for you,” Gen. Berger allegedly told her. Please help support alternative media. We follow the truth, wherever it leads. We reject absolutely big-tech and the narrow, dogmatic views of MSM.

7559d493,Coverup on Benghazi does make a difference,"Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responds to questioning on the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2013. Credit: Jason Reed / Reuters  By  Fifteen months ago, I asked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton why she hadn't simply picked up the phone and talked to the Benghazi survivors to find out what had actually happened. Instead of being straightforward, she deflected this uncomfortable question with a now-infamous question of her own: What difference, at this point, does it make?  The answer to that question and the motive behind this administration's lies and coverup are finally becoming quite clear. The belated release of a Sept. 14, 2012, talking points email from deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes proves that senior White House officials were fully engaged in directing the coverup and perpetuating the lies.  According to the Rhodes email, the goal of the administration's Benghazi spin was to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy. This was in spite of the fact that within hours of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack, the administration knew — or certainly should have known — there was no protest.  So why did the administration lie to America?  Because the truth would have damaged President Barack Obama's re-election chances and further revealed Clinton's dereliction of duty that contributed to the unnecessary deaths of four brave Americans. She fully understood her culpability in the Benghazi tragedy, which is why she reacted so testily to my reasonable line of questioning.  The outrages surrounding the Benghazi attack involve administration action, or lack of action, before, during and after the attack.  The greatest outrages occurred before the attack. The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security but instead actually reduced security in Libya. Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost.  The outrageous act of omission during the attack was that no additional defensive or offensive military assets were immediately dispatched to help the endangered personnel in Benghazi. Although it is true that no intervention to save the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens or diplomat Sean Smith was possible, I do not believe the same can be said with certainty concerning U.S. personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who also were killed that night.  No one could know with certainty that the survivors would be able to get to the airport and be safely evacuated within 12 hours. What if they had encountered resistance en route to the airport? There were military assets in Croatia that could have arrived within the 12-hour window it took the survivors to reach safety. Didn't the administration feel obligated to deploy every asset available until the moment the survivors were safe?  Finally, there are the outrageous lies and coverups after the attack. There were many, but I want to concentrate on one: Clinton's comments to Woods' father at the moment she should have been demonstrating only genuine compassion.  Imagine yourself in her role, honoring the remains of four brave Americans who had given their lives for their country. Would you have taken that moment to offer sincere condolences and to grieve with the families? Or would you have seized the opportunity to plant and perpetuate the coverup of your dereliction of duty?  In the words of Woods' father, Clinton did the latter: Hillary Clinton came up to me and I gave her a handshake and a hug, and when I shook her hand, she said to me, 'We are going to have the filmmaker arrested.' Even at that time, she was trying to place a spin on what happened.  What difference does it make? I'll let my fellow Americans judge for themselves.

50efae0c,Competitive Elections Wisconsin issues open letter to State Assembly Speaker,"Press Release via Competitive Elections Wisconsin.  Open Letter to Rep. Robin Vos, Speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly  Speaker Vos,  Wisconsin’s legislature suffers from a serious deficit of democracy. Thanks to restrictive and anti-competitive ballot laws, almost half of Representatives 47 out of 99 were the only name on the ballot in the November 2014 general election. That’s half of voters who got no debate, no discussion, no choice- no real election at all. A similarly large number of races were uncontested in the August primary. In the 12th Assembly District, I was one of many who had no choice in either the primary or the general election.  This is compared to just 9 out of 134 Representatives who ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties. It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are.  Voters are, in fact, viscerally disgusted when they go to the polls only to find that their time has been wasted with slates of unopposed candidates. So why do our State Assembly elections look more like the selection of a Soviet Politburo or House of Lords than a freely-elected American state legislature?  The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high. These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it. This is often couched in terms of “serious candidates only” – a decision that is surely for voters to make.  This policy harms voters by denying them a debate and a choice, but it also wastes taxpayer resources as the Government Accountability Board scrambles to scrutinize tens of thousands of signatures by statutory deadlines. This process, where candidates are invited to try to kick each other off the ballot based on technicalities, serves no legitimate public interest. The argument against an overcrowded ballot strains credulity in the face of severely under-crowded ballots.  A simple and obvious measure which could be taken to help fix this problem, before the 2016 election, would be to reduce the number of signatures required on nomination petitions by half, across the board. This would bring Wisconsin in line with the norm in neighboring states, and greatly reduce the number of uncontested elections. Such a modest reform would also not require any other substantive changes to the structure of Wisconsin’s election laws.  All voters should demand free, open, fair, and competitive elections, where all ideas can be heard and considered as part of our civic discourse. Citizens who wish to engage in the democratic process as candidates, should not face unreasonable barriers to entry.

e92ede13,"Randi Weingarten, Teachers Union Head, Sounds Off On Atlanta Cheating Scandal","We do not condone cheating under any circumstances. Academic achievement can never be separated from academic integrity, which is why the Georgia Federation of Teachers was the first whistle-blower to expose Atlanta testing irregularities.  Tragically, the Atlanta cheating scandal harmed our children and it crystallizes the unintended consequences of our test-crazed policies. Standardized tests have a role in accountability, but today they dominate everything else and too often don't even correlate to what students need to know to succeed.  No amount of testing will replace what works to improve teaching and learning: giving teachers the resources and tools they need to be great teachers and providing students with a rich and well-rounded curriculum. Covering up kids' academic deficiencies cheats students out of the targeted help they deserve.  It is outrageous that schools in some states are spending up to 100 days a year doing test-prep or actual testing. We have to re-order our priorities and move our schools from a test-based culture to one that is deeply rooted in instruction and learning, so that our kids can become engaged participants in the knowledge economy and our democracy.  School districts in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere placed enormous pressure on teachers to show improved scores, but the hard truth is that cheating on high-stakes testing doesn't fix public schools or help kids. And even with this intense pressure, the vast majority of teachers do everything they can to help kids and never succumb to cheating. They know there are no shortcuts to success. Moving the needle requires a balanced approach that focuses on high-quality instruction; a rich curriculum; appropriate and useful assessments; and additional help and other resources like tutoring, after-school activities and social services to enable teachers and students to be successful.",partially false

After over 100 years of selling its caramel popcorn snack under the name Cracker Jack, Frito-Lay announced today that it would be rebranded as the less offensive Caucasian Jack.  We are very sorry to all the crack---er, I mean, Caucasians we have hurt over the years, said a spokesperson. Cracker is an offensive stereotype, and we must make sure that all foods and snack products are culturally sensitive. Think about all the white people who have had to suffer in silence as tens of thousands of baseball fans sang out the hurtful lyrics 'Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks.'  No more. The bigotry stops today.  The move was applauded by hurt white people, though they are still criticizing Frito-Lay for how pale and pasty-white the Cracker Jack guy is on the logo.",false
ffd139b7,International Red Cross Report Confirms the Holocaust of Six Million Jews is a Hoax,"OFFICIAL INTERNATIONAL RED CROSS RECORDS RELEASED  Sealed and guarded since the end of WWII at Arolsen, Germany, the Official IRC records reveal the actual Concentration Camp total death toll was 271,301  For years, people around the world – “the West” in particular – have been told that “six million Jews were systematically murdered by Germans in ‘Concentration Camps’ during World War 2.”  Thousands of honest people disputing this claim have been viciously smeared as a hateful anti-Semite. Several countries around the world have jailed and heavily fined people for disputing the claim that “6 Million” Jews were killed.  Provided here is a scanned image of an Official International Red Cross document, proving the so-called “Holocaust” [the long-and-often-claimed-6-million Jews] is just plain wrong. Jews around the world have intentionally exaggerated and perpetually lied for the purpose of gaining political, emotional and business advantages for themselves.  They committed willful, criminal FRAUD upon millions of trusting people around the world!  Please NOTE that the truth has been known since long before 1979! The above compiler, replying to a letter, had to rely on information that was already in existence!  Tax-payers of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Latvia, Poland and other nations have had multiple millions of dollars taken from their wages to be paid out to “holocaust survivors” and their descendants for something that DID NOT HAPPEN.  The tax-payers of these United States of America spend Billion$ each year in direct, indirect and military support of the State of Israel which is not Biblical Israel.  This is intentional, criminal fraud on a scale so massive as to be almost incomprehensible.  Red Cross and East German government figures put the total deaths at every camp as 272.000, and 282,000 respectively which includes homosexuals, communists, gypsies, murderers, paedophiles etc. The 6 Million figure is a Kabbalist number, a magickal figure which featured in newspapers in the early 1900’s.  Where do the innocent Germans, Americans and others go to get a refund?  I call for criminal prosecution of individuals and groups who filed false lawsuits to obtain holocaust reparations and financial damage awards and perpetrating deliberate fraud upon Courts.  I call for the removal of Holocaust references in History books and educational materials.  I call for the removal of Holocaust Memorials worldwide.  It is long overdue that this intentional fraud be halted and those who perpetrated it be brought to justice for over 60 years of National Blood Libel against Germany and other nations through vicious lies and financial fraud.  Two of the most important surveys of the Jewish question in Europe during World War II are David Irving’s examination of the Russian archives after the wall came down. Irving published his findings in his book, “Hitler’s War” and said not one word about gas chambers.  When questioned about this omission he said that there was no reference to gas chambers in the archives and therefore he did not discuss the question of gas chambers. Irving was arrested in several countries for hate speech for his scholarly omission.  The International Red Cross published their analysis in a three volume “Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on its Activities during the Second World War” published in Geneva in 1948. This analysis expanded findings of two previous publications: “Sur L’activite’ du CICR en faveur des civils detencus dans les camps de concentration en Allemagne 1939-1945 Geneva, 1946 and “Inter Arma Caritas: The Work of the ICRF during the Second World War” Geneva, 1947.  In 1949 the International Red Cross interviewed prisoners in the German camps. They were not allowed to interview prisoners in the Russian camps which were far more harsh.  The German camps held both political prisoners Schutzhaflinge and those convicted of crimes. The Germans allowed the Red Cross to distribute food, medicine and clothing to the prisoners.  Grateful prisoners sent letters of thanks from Dachau, Buchenwalk, Sangerhausen, Sachsenhausen, Oranienburg, Flossenburg, Landsberg-am-Lech, Fibha, Ravensbruck, Hamburg-Neuengamme, Mauthausen, Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen and others.  “The principal recipients were Belgians, Dutch, French, Greeks, Italians, Norwegians, Poles and stateless Jews” Vol. III, p. 83.  Regarding Theresienstadt, the Red Cross said, “where there were about 40,000 Jews deported from various countries, was a relatively privileged ghetto” Vol. III, p. 75.  “The Committee’s delegates were able to visit the camp at Theresienstadt Terezin which was used exclusively for Jews and was governed by special conditions … From information gathered by the Commitee, this camp had been started as an experiment by certain leaders of the Reich … These men wished to give the Jews the means of setting up a communal life in a town under their own administration and possessing almost complete autonomy … two delegates were able to visit the camp on April 6, 1945. They confirmed the favourable impression gained on the first visit” Vol. I, p. 642.  The ICRC also had praise for the regime of Ion Antonescu of Fascist Rumania where the Committee was able to extend special relief to 183,000 Rumanian Jews until the time of the Soviet occupation.  The aid then ceased and the ICRC complained bitterly that it never succeeded “in sending anything whatsoever to Russia” Vol. II, p. 62. The same situation applied to many of the German camps after their “liberation” by the Russians.  The ICRC received a voluminous flow of mail from Auschwitz until the period of the Soviet occupation, when many of the internees were evacuated westward. But the efforts of the Red Cross to send relief to internees remaining at Auschwitz under Soviet control were futile.  However, food parcels continued to be sent to former Auschwitz inmates transferred west to such camps as Buchenwald and Oranienburg.  NO MENTION OF GAS CHAMBERS  One of the most important aspects of the Report of the ICRC is that it clarifies the true cause of those deaths that undoubtedly occurred in the camps towards the end of the war.  Says the Report: “in the chaotic condition of Germany after the invasion during the final months of the war, the camps received no food supplies at all and starvation claimed an increasing number of victims.  Itself alarmed by this situation, the German Government at last informed the ICRC on February 1, 1945 … In March 1945, discussions between the President of the ICRC and General of the S.S. Kaltenbrunner gave even more decisive results.  Relief could henceforth be distributed by the ICRC and one delegate was authorised to stay in each camp .I.” Vol. III, p.83.  Clearly, the German authorities were at pains to relieve the dire situation as far as they were able.  The Red Cross are quite explicit in stating that food supplies ceased at this time due to the Allied bombing of German transportation, and in the interests of interned Jews they had protested on March 15, 1944 against “the barbarous aerial warfare of the Allies” Inter Armet Caritns, p. 78. B  By October 2, 1944, the ICRC had warned the German Foreign Office of the impending collapse of the German transportation system, declaring that starvation conditions for people throughout Germany were becoming inevitable.  In dealing with this comprehensive, three-volume Report, it is important to stress that the delegates of the International Red Cross found no evidence whatsoever of ‘gas chambers’.  The original 1946 edition did not even talk of ‘extermination’ or ‘death camps’ but after the emotional impact of the Nuremberg trials the Red Cross felt compelled to introduce into the expanded 1948 Report several, very cursory references to ‘death camps’ Vol. 1 p. 641 and ‘extermination camps’ Vol. I p. 645. However, no means of’extermination’ is indicated.  In all its 1,600 pages the three-volume Report does not even mention such a thing as a ‘gas chamber’. It acknowledges that Jews, like many other wartime nationalities, suffered rigours and privations, but’ its complete silence on the subject of ’gassings’ is ample refutation of the ‘Holocaust’ legend.  NOT ALL WERE INTERNED  Volume III of the Report of the ICRC, Chapter 3 I. Jewish Civilian Population deals with the “aid given to the Jewish section of the free population” and this chapter makes it quite plain that by no means all of the European Jews were placed in internment camps but remained, subject to certain restrictions, as part of the free civilian population.  This conflicts directly with the “thoroughness” of the supposed “extermination programme”, and with the claim in the forged Hoess memoirs that Eichmann was obsessed with seizing every single Jew he could lay his hands on,” In Slovakia, for example, where Eichmann’s assistant Dieter Wisliceny was in charge, the Report states that “A large proportian of the Jewish minority had permission to stay in the country, and at certain periods Slovakia was looked upon as a comparative haven of refuge for Jews, especially for those coming from Poland.  Those who remained in Slovakia seem to have been in comparative safety until the end of August 1944, when a rising against the German forces took place. While it is true that the law of May 15, 1942 had brought about the internment of several thousand Jews, these people were held in camps where the conditions of food and lodging were tolerable, and where the internees were allowed to do paid work on terms almost equal to those of the free labour market” Vol. I, p. 646.  Not only did large numbers of the three million or so European Jews avoid internment altogether, but the emigration of Jews continued throughout the war, generally by way of Hungary, Rumania and Turkey. Ironically, post-war Jewish emigration from German-occupied territories was also facilitated by the Reich, as in the case of the Polish Jews who had escaped to France before its occupation.  “The Jews from Poland who, whilst in France, had obtained entrance permits to the United States were held to be American citizens by the German occupying authorities, who further agreed to recognise the validity of about three thousand passports issued to Jews by the consulates of South American countries” Vol. 1, p. 645.  As future U.S. citizens, these Jews were held at the Vittel camp in southern France for American aliens. The emigration of European Jews from Hungary in particular proceeded during the war unhindered by the German authorities. “Until March 1944,” says the Red Cross Report, “Jews who had the privilege of visas for Palestine were free to leave Hungary” Vol. 1, p. 648. Even after the replacement of the Horthy Government in 1944 following its attempted armistice with the Soviet Union with a government more dependent on German authority, the emigration of Jews continued.  The Committee secured the pledges of both Britain and the United States “to give support by every means to the emigration of Jews from Hungary, ” and from the U.S. Government the ICRC received a message stating that “The Government of the United States… now specifically repeats its assurance that arrangements will be made by it for the care of all Jews who in the present circumstances are allowed to leave” Vol. 1, p. 649.  …………  Official International Red Cross Records Released  Sealed And Guarded Since The End Of WWII At Arolsen, Germany,  The Official IRC Records Reveal The Actual Concentration Camp Total Death  Toll Was 271,301  http://monamontgomery.com/products/271304.htm  ***  The Source of the six million figure is a Talmudic Jewish Talmud reference to a future holocaust in which six million Jews die.  The reason why they are claiming six million deaths in Nazi camps, even though that number vastly exceeds the number of Jews in Europe at the time, is because this reference in their scripture is something they fear deeply and wish to prevent at all costs.  The Ashkenazi Jews, which I have experience with honestly believe that prophecy is real, but can be manipulated.  They believe that prophets see into the future, and see what was believed and said, and then write that down as much as they reveal the word of GOD.  SO there is a group of Ashkenazi Jews who wish to make the six million figure HISTORY to prevent it from ever happening in the FUTURE by repeating this number over and over and over into the social concience, in the hope that prophets of old will also latch onto this, and report it as a factual event in the future, which would now be history.  In other words, they believe they can lie themselves a new future. I don’t think so – I think their hardest days are ahead and one thing is certain, the genie is out of the bottle and through the word, the real truth of Fukushima may be like silly putty slowly sinking into the carpet, eventually it will be TOTALLY sunk in the carpet and nothing will get it out.  THIS could cause the six million Jewish deaths the prophecy speaks of, and No, I do not believe they can lie their way out of it.

1b88a3a2,Pelosi’s Daughters Arrested Breaking Into Liquor Store For ‘Quarantine Supplies’,"The apples don’t fall far from the tree, they say, and nowhere is it more obvious than in the case of Nancy Pelosi‘s daughters. Often in trouble, they have lately shown that they share the trait most commonly associated with their mother…..a hopeless addiction to alcohol.  Both Melissa, 21, and Daphne, 19, were arrested this past weekend in San Francisco, California for breaking and entering. Officers were alerted to their crime by a silent alarm at “This Is The Way To Liquor,” a liquor store close to their home that had recently decided to temporarily close due to slow sales during the state’s lockdown.  The sisters had been incredibly upset by the decision to close, as the massive warehouse of spirits was their preferred place to shop for their partying needs. So this past Friday evening when they ran out of refreshments, the Pelosis decided that they would go there and just help themselves. Entering through the back door, the siblings walked in and proceeded to take from the shelves whatever they deserved, consuming as they went. It was a real ransacking.  The first officer on the scene was none other than Joe Barron, who gave a brief summary of the night’s events:  “The two girls were absolutely obliterated drunk. They thought that they had every right to be there for being loyal customers over the years and couldn’t understand why we had come to arrest them. They shouted out that they had to be there because they needed ‘vital quarantine supplies.’  When it did finally dawn on them that they were going to lock-up, they simply laughed and said that mommy would get them out right away and that I would lose my job for arresting ‘California royalty,’ as they called themselves. That was all I needed to hear. The handcuffs went on, and the daughters Pelosi spent the night in the drunk tank. I wish we could’ve kept the spoiled brats even longer.”  Mother Nancy did manage to get them sprung, but not until morning, as she was not alerted to their capture until after she had woken up from her own drunken stupor. And yes, charges previously filed by the DA were mysteriously dropped, despite all the flawless evidence in their possession with which to prosecute. Once again, Democrat corruption reared its head.",false
2695c66d,Study Confirms Cannabinoids Occur Naturally In Human Breast Milk,"Study Confirms Cannabinoids Occur Naturally In Human Breast Milk  In January 2017 a study confirmed that cannabinoids occur naturally in human breast milk-and it’s proving now to still be as relevant of a study as ever.  According to the findings of several major scientific studies, human breast milk naturally contains of the same cannabinoids found in the cannabis plant, which are vital for proper human development.  Cell membranes in the body are naturally equipped with these cannabinoid receptors which, when activated support and maintain human health. Human breast milk is an abundant source of endocannabinoids, a specific type of neuromodulatory lipid that basically teaches a newborn child how to eat by stimulating the suckling process.  Dr. Melanie Dreher studied women using cannabis during their entire pregnancy and then studied the babies one year after birth. She found that babies of the women who had smoked cannabis daily during their pregnancy socialised more quickly, made eye contact more quickly and were easier to engage.  If it were not for these cannabinoids in breast milk, newborn children would not know how to eat, nor would they necessarily have the desire to eat, which could result in severe malnourishment and even death. Newborn children who are breastfed naturally receive doses of cannabinoids that trigger hunger and promote growth and development.  Observations of how babies acts after being fed show they exhibit symptoms of cannabinoid use. As well as the essential function of stimulating an infants appetite, cannabinoids also help to calm and relax the baby. Cannabinoids are not, however, present in baby formula, which makes it far more inferior to breast milk.  Furthermore, a study on the endocannabinoid receptor system that was published in the European Journal of Pharmacology reported: “The medical implications of these novel developments are far reaching and suggest a promising future for cannabinoids in paediatric medicine for conditions including ‘non-organic failure-to-thrive’ and cystic fibrosis.”  There are two types of cannabinoid receptors in the body; the CB1 variety which exists in the brain, and the CB2 variety which exists in the immune system and throughout the rest of the body. Each one of these receptors responds to cannabinoids, whether it be from human breast milk in children, or from cannabis.  This essentially means that the human body requires and produces endocannabinoids, as these nutritive substances play a critical role in supporting and maintaining human health.

567d506a,Trump Wins $500 Million Libel Lawsuit Against CNN,"CNN is well-known to be a lying liberal rag of a news source. They say all sorts of mean things about our President, many of them true. This is why President Trump decided to sue them for all they’re worth, for exposing him and saying horrible things.  Luckily for the American people, the Supreme Court decided in favor of the President, awarding him 500 million dollars, the largest fictitious libel lawsuit in American history. This lawsuit had no chance of losing, as it was written up by famed Constitutional attorney, Chad Benoit, who has never lost a case in his 15-year career.  Justice Joe Barron, who made the decision, gave the following statement when issuing the verdict:  “Libel laws are essential to Democracy. They keep the press honest, and they keep the truth from being washed away. That is why I rule in favor of Donald Trump. CNN has said so many nasty things about him. Despite being truthful, it is wrong to say bad things about the President, as that is un-American. FOX News never said nasty lies about Obama, so why should CNN be able to? All networks must be held to the same standard, and that is what this ruling intends to do.”  President Trump has been hard at work today, tweeting about his latest victory in court. Here is his latest tweet about the ruling:  “FAKE NEWS CNN LOSES AGAIN! THEY HAVE TO PAY 500 MILLION TO ME. WILL BE USING TO FUND FOX NEWS AND ESCORT!”  This is a great day in American history, as it shows that the media will finally be held accountable, and it will expose the hypocrites in the comments for who they really are.",false
5491b156,"Software issue in Michigan gave Biden an estimated 6,000 Trump votes","Editor note and update: Since our original article was published, the Michigan secretary of state’s office has published a notice explaining that the Antrim county reporting mistake resulted from a user error, not a software error, and did not affect the election results or other counties or states. — ANTRIM COUNTY, MI -This is an update to an earlier report we filed about a computer “glitch” in Antrim County, Michigan which was reported to have only affected two Republican votes in the important swing state. However, the Detroit Free Press is reporting it was much, much worse. According to Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy, a Republican who ran unopposed and won a third term on Tuesday in a very strong Republican county, results on electronic tapes and a computer card were apparently accurate, however when the results were transcribed from the cards to a computer, something appeared to be wrong. In 2016, President Trump won the county with around 62% of the vote, compared to 33% for Hillary Clinton. The president outpolled Clinton by 4,000 votes. Wednesday morning after the election, results in the county showed Biden leading the president by around 3,000 votes with 98% of precincts reporting. Nothing to see here, right? Guy said that officials hadn’t checked the results prior to posting them, however later asked: “How could Democrats take over this county?” Clearly, that made zero sense. She said that officials were going over the tape of the results and inputting the numbers manually. Antrim uses Dominion voting equipment and doesn’t use cellular modems to transmit results from precincts to county offices. Rather, the data is transported by election officials, Guy said. She originally noted she was in talks with the company that maintains the equipment but said it could be the result of “human error.” Tom McMillin, a former state lawmaker from Oakland County told the Detroit Free Press that he is estimating that both President Trump and US Senate Candidate John James could realize between 4,000-5,000 votes each. Joe Gumm, a local news anchor with KXXV-TV tweeted about Michigan’s use of the same Election Source program and noted that 33 other counties used that same possibly compromised program to compile their vote totals. A political commentator, Dennis Lennox also questioned the vote totals from other counties in the state. “Trump did not lose #AntrimCounty in #Michigan. It is now confirmed that 32 other counties use the same software as Antrim County. He will get 6,000 plus votes out of Antrim. What about the other counties with the same software?” he tweeted. But according to AFP: Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office released a statement on November 7 explaining what went wrong in Antrim, and how it was corrected. “The error in reporting unofficial results in Antrim County Michigan was the result of a user error that was quickly identified and corrected; did not affect the way ballots were actually tabulated; and would have been identified in the county canvass before official results were reported even if it had not been identified earlier,” the statement said. The software program, Election Source, worked properly and correctly counted votes, but the county missed an operation step, the statement said. This resulted in a miscommunication between the software and the county’s central election management system that was quickly corrected. “This was an isolated error, there is no evidence this user error occurred elsewhere in the state, and if it did it would be caught during county canvasses, which are conducted by bipartisan boards of county canvassers.” Antrim County Clerk Sheryl Guy is quoted on the county’s Facebook page: “We continue to work hard to ensure the integrity of the election results.” It will be interesting to see if the 138,339 vote dump that went to Biden under the cover of darkness early Wednesday morning , with The Federalist noting that “Biden somehow got all of the votes, and Trump got none, zero, in an overnight vote-dump.” An apparent “issue” with an election ballot counting program caused only two votes to be tallied for Republican candidates. The problem is being blamed on programming “infrastructure” and could be prevalent through other counties across the state of Michigan. Two major races are impacted by this “issue”: President, with Joe Biden now leading Donald Trump in the state; and United States Senate, with John James losing to Democratic incumbent Gary Peters. The problem was discovered Wednesday morning. Republican state legislator Triston Cole heard of the two votes cast for Representative Jack Bergman in his county that were counted, and responded: “I can guarantee that there were 6 [Bergman votes] in my immediate family alone.” Election results are no longer posted on the county’s website, and county authorities released an official statement: “Early this morning, the Antrim County Clerk, Sheryl Guy, became aware of apparently skewed results in the Unofficial Election Result tabulations. Since then, the Clerk’s Office has been reviewing the results and the multiple redundancies to search out any possible discrepancies. Staff is currently working with township officials and with Election Source, the company that provides the voting software programs and hardware.” Sheryl Guy reported that vote totals on printed tabulator tapes and totals counted by the election software did not match. The printed tabulated tapes from each precinct will now be counted manually as a result. There have been more than 16,000 votes cast in Antrim County. Michigan Republican party chairperson Laura Cox stated: “The irregularities reported this morning are incredibly troubling, especially given how close the election results are in Michigan.” On Wednesday, the Trump campaign filed suit against the state of Michigan, claiming poll observers had been denied access to polling sites. Trump campaign statement on #Michigan lawsuit pic.twitter.com/T7FSfp3MVA — Team Trump Text VOTE to 88022 @TeamTrump November 4, 2020 Like neighboring state Wisconsin, Michigan is claiming record voter turnout – a claim that draws both pride and skepticism. Reports and rumors of tons of ballots mysteriously appearing in the middle of the night have cast doubt on these turnout claims. Officially, Michigan is claiming that more than 5,260,000 citizens have voted. Challengers to election results for and against both parties have arrived at polling locations in the state. The TCF Convention Center is Detroit is ground zero for these groups, with about 50 challengers representing the Republicans. Other groups include the ACLU, NAACP, and union group representatives. Branden Snyder, executive director of Detroit Action, a housing and economic justice group stated: “We got a call that they needed more volunteers. Our goal is to make sure the process is fair and equal.” It is unknown on what authority Mr. Snyder used in his action afterwards, but when more than 100 opposing challengers arrived at the TCF Center, he turned them away for the day. In other election irregularities, the United States Postal Service USPS failed to comply with a federal court order, effectively ignoring the order. The USPS indicated that it couldn’t meet the 3 p.m. deadline set by U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan for facilities to sweep their buildings for mail-in ballots. As judge orders USPS to do twice-daily sweeps for remaining ballots, @APWUnational president says postal workers “moved heaven and earth” to count the record mail-in ballots “as a civic duty.” https://t.co/cB1cVIbEMq — Dinah Voyles Pulver @DinahVP November 6, 2020 The USPS also failed to comply with an order to allow election inspectors to inspect mail service in places like Detroit to make sure all mailed in ballots had been deposited at election drop-off sites. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy filed a response to Judge Sullivan’s order, indicating the service didn’t have enough inspectors to cover the task. USPS processed 150,000 ballots after Election Day, jeopardizing thousands of votes https://t.co/RDW0V0Nwpo — Bo Snerdley @BoSnerdley November 6, 2020 There will certainly be a discussion and possible sanctions over the “apparent lack of compliance with the Court’s order,” according to an after-action order filed by Sullivan. He did acknowledge the USPS postmaster’s efforts and would likely let them continue their operation in reference to the election.

John James campaign accusing local officials of voter suppression and election interference in Michigan Senate race November 5, 2020 DETROIT, MI- As Michigan continued to count ballots the day after Election Day, Republican John James’ Senate campaign accused local officials of impropriety, voter suppression, and election interference after incumbent Gary Peters picked up hundreds of thousands of votes overnight. John James Campaign Claims Irregularities in Michigan Senate Race https://t.co/10NvXMvL1D — James Woods @RealJamesWoods November 5, 2020 Fox News reported that James’ allegations came as chaos unfolded outside a vote tally room at the TCF Center in downtown Detroit where all mail-in absentee ballots were being collected. The chaos caused officials to place cardboard over the window in order to obstruct the public’s view as well as bar individuals from coming into the room. Stuart Sandler, a consultant for James’ campaign, who also observed the count as a volunteer lawyer, told Fox News that they believe there were “a lot of irregularities” throughout the process that must be looked into. Sandler said in a statement: “There were all kinds of chicanery, including ballots that came in reportedly in the middle of the night at 3:30 a.m. 35,000 ballots that were deceptively brought in.” He added: “There have been a lot of irregularities and lack of integrity.

2d416d3f,CDC Latest Update On Antibody Testing Results,"The Center for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is essentially setting policy across the country, endlessly putting out a stream of so-called facts that they then revise or rescind.  Their latest update on COVID-19, posted on Tuesday, is headlined: What do your results mean?  “A positive test result shows you may have antibodies from an infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. However, there is a chance a positive result means that you have antibodies from an infection with a virus from the same family of viruses called coronaviruses, such as the one that causes the common cold.”  This is the case for the “past infection” test, not the current COVID-19 test to see if you have the virus right now. Current case counts do not include the antibody test and the antibodies are not detectable until well into or after the illness.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  Coronaviruses CoV — called that because they have spikes around a central ball that looks like the sun — are part of a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from a cold to more severe diseases, including COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2, and others such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome MERS-CoV and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome SARS-CoV.  SARS -CoV-2 is also known as a novel coronavirus nCoV because it is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans.  Many of the symptoms from coronaviruses are similar: upper respiratory infection, fever, coughing, sneezing. While MERS and SARS can be serious — and SARS-CoV-2 as well, at least for the elderly and others with co-morbidities — most are treatable and nearly all people afflicted recover.  So why does the CDC frame it this way?  J.B. Neiman, a managing partner and general counsel of a Texas-based health care company that owns 13 free-standing clinics, has an idea. He told former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, who has been on the forefront of covering the facts behind COVID-19, that the bottom line is money.  Neiman told Berenson he has “heard several stories of how discharge planners are being pressured to put Covid as primary diagnosis — as that pays significantly better. Hospitals want to avoid the discussion but if they don’t they risk another shutdown. This may be an explanation for why there is a gap in hospital executives saying they have plenty of capacity and the increasing number of Covid hospitalizations. You open up your hospitals for normal medical care and you test everyone of those patients — the result is higher percentage of patients who have Covid — now.”  The mainstream media is breathlessly reporting a spike in new infections even though we’re all wearing masks, so how’d that happen?.  But virtually no one is reporting that deaths from the virus are way down.  On June 27, there were 623 deaths attributed to COVID-19, according to OurWorldInData.com. Two days later, the death toll in the U.S. was 265.  By comparison, 4,928 people died in the U.S. on the peak day, April 16. Deaths have been declining steadily, at least until June 26, when the toll reached 2,437 the website notes that “some states added probable deaths” on that date. The deaths rose again to 1,270 on Tuesday, but at least one COVID watchdog said there was again a reason for that rise.  “That ‘spike’ yesterday includes more than 600 backdated NYC cases, most from three weeks or more ago. In reality deaths dropped again week over week about 25%,” Berenson wrote on Twitter.",false

Is there thirty billion dollars in there? No? Then your last name isn’t “Obama”, and you don’t own your own private “safe island” where you and your family and friends can wait out any crisis that the unwashed masses have to suffer through.  Preparations to have every tree on the island set up to stream Netflix will be finished by April.  Two days ago, while you and I were washing our hands and not going to the theater to see whatever terrible movie the distributors release in March before saving all the good ones for May, June, and July, the Obama family flew by private jet liner to their private safe island, somewhere in the Pacific tropics, where they will remain safe and sound from any harm. Several friends and family members flew in on later flights, including religious leader Al Sharpton, actor Jussie Smolette, and basketball star Joe Barron.  The multi-billion dollar island, dubbed “Smoovy-O-Town” on nautical charts is over thirty-six miles in area. The main living mansion resides on the eastern coach with a private beach, tennis courts, and indoor football field, as well as several fresh-water and Noxema-filled swimming pools. Nearby the domicile is a fully-functioning private mall, with it’s own Cinnabon, Spencer’s Gifts, Gamestop, and not one, but two Starbucks. To the island’s northern side sits the Obama Command Center, with a private security force, a well-defined hospital, and a factory constantly producing a biologically-engineered apple-like fruit known to cause instant orgasm.  All.of this setup certainly seems like the Obamas have written off helping their fellow Americans in any way, and no word has been released detailing how long they plan to hide on the island during this trying time. But it does feel, some people say, like the attitude being presented is that : “Obama Lives Matter.” Maybe billions of dollars more than yours or mine.  Share this:  .  .",false
6a72f5c5,"James Woods, Actor, Patriot, and Trump Supporter, Dead at 74","James Humphrey Terwilliger Woods, conservative icon, award-winning actor, and patriotic Trump supporter was found dead in his home last night at 74.  According to police reports, they haven’t ruled out foul play, though they can’t imagine who would want Mr. Woods dead. Lead detective Art Tubolls told us that this was one of the saddest cases he’s ever worked:  “To find such a great man slumped over like that was devastating. All I could think about was his portrayal of Roy Cohn, whom he shared so much in common with in real life. “Mr. Woods is a national treasure, dead or alive.”  The coroner hasn’t released an official cause of death:  “We’re not quite sure what happened yet, and we don’t like to speculate. “There is, however, growing evidence that Woods may have died of embarrasment after sharing an article from a liberal troll’s satire network that was both ridiculous and clearly disclaimered. And it wasn’t the first time. It’s sad, but many of that generation seem to have the same issues. Woods is just…a tater. Like the rest of the Trump supporters over 65.”  The FBI has vowed to get involved if they can confirm that Woods was the victim of a hate crime, as long as his buddy Curt Schilling, who was also dumb enough to comment on the fake article, ends up dead, too.  Schilling’s agent says he’s not sure if Curt would go for it, since he’d have to die to collect, but that he’d be happy to do three somersaults for $50.

It’s frankly hard to comprehend a tragedy of this magnitude. It’s evil and senseless.  But what we’ve seen since are the acts of brave men and women that give us hope in our darkest times. Citizens selflessly sacrificing themselves to save others. Law enforcement putting themselves in harm’s way to catch the perpetrator. Lines down the block to donate blood to help victims.  And it’s past time for Washington insiders to take a cue from these American heroes doing everything they can to save lives, and do their part.  I’m at the table and ready to talk to all stakeholders about what we can do to stop this violence. There are absolutely solutions that most Americans agree on that could save lives. But the powerful special interests that have rigged the system are saying “no.” Well, I’ve never bowed to them before, and I certainly won’t now when lives are at risk.

e592fd47,What if the conspiracy theories are true?,"I attended a dinner party this past weekend and was intrigued by the tone of the conversations that swirled around the room. There were, of course, the typical fluff conversations that were intended to lightly touch the surface of various subjects – but then there were conversations circling around Ebola and an underlying distrust of the government.  This was actually surprising to me, since I was in the heart of Los Angeles and these people were definitely not clinging to their guns and religion. The majority of them were upper middle class – baby boomers and yuppies who would never want to be thought of as conservative, but as more libertarian in their political views.  I sat with two men and a woman who were debating the question of whether or not Ebola was something to really be concerned about, and their comments took me aback. The men were bringing up the fact that in the past few years, everything that has come out of Washington has been misleading or an out and out lie – from Obamacare, if you like your doctor, to the Department of Veterans Affairs allowing vets to die waiting for an appointment. They said that they were viewing the reassurances about Ebola coming from the CDC with a skeptical eye. Their biggest question was: Why is there no urgency to stop the disease from entering the U.S.?  At that point I jumped in with some facts I had just discovered about the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, who has been the out front spokesman on the Ebola crisis. I found an article published by the Washington Post on July 16 of this year reporting that Frieden had been called to testify on Capitol Hill about researchers at his agency that had mishandled live anthrax and other deadly pathogens in a number of mishaps over the past year or so. This came on the heels of federal officials finding forgotten smallpox samples in a storage room at the National Institute for Health campus in Bethesda, Maryland. They also discovered 12 boxes and 327 vials with pathogens that included the virus behind dengue and spotted fever. When Frieden testified about the anthrax, his response was: We missed a critical pattern, and the pattern is an insufficient culture of safety. Really? And this is the guy in charge of making decisions on Ebola?

TRENDING: Voters blame Biden for border crisis, ready to punish Democrats, poll says  Upon hearing this latest evidence of the incompetence permeating our government, the conversation veered into conspiracy territory. One of the men brought up the fact that Washington has known for months if not years that we were at risk for some sort of global pandemic. According to a government supplier of emergency products, the Disaster Assistance Response Team was told to be prepared to be activated in the month of October for an outbreak of Ebola. Hmm, that's just like the fact that they knew 60,000 illegal children were going to be coming across our southern border eight months before it happened.  Questions were then brought up about the stockpiling of ammunition and weapons by Homeland Security over the past couple of years and the $1 billion worth of disposable FEMA coffins supposedly stored in Georgia. Why was there preparation being made for FEMA camps to house people in isolation? These were the questions being seriously discussed.  Recent polls show that there is a crisis of confidence among the people. When the people lose all trust in their government because of the lies they have been told over and over again, theories begin to emerge about all sorts of things. We desperately need someone to rebuild the trust and restore faith in this government. The damage that has been done is almost irreparable.  My fear is that this has all been orchestrated from the very beginning. Who knows? Maybe the current administration needs this to happen so martial law can be declared, guns can be seized and the populace can be controlled. Once that happens … game over.

The four want the Holy Bible to be declared material containing ‘hate speech’ and dealt with appropriately, either through thorough censorship or an outright ban.  Asked to explain their reasoning by email, we were sent a barrage of venomous accusations about Biblical text. Some of the cleaner, more publishable replies can be seen below.  From Cortez:  “It promotes slavery, sexual assault, and murder. It’s basically an incitement to violence. How can we call ourselves a civilized society when we allow this garbage to be used as a reference for morality?”  Tlaib:  “The bible is racist. It suggests that Christians are superior and that all others are inferior beings. It might as well be calling everybody else primates. Its message amounts to the same”  Omar:  “That vile volume says that the faiths of others are not real. It tells the readers to convert those of more superior religions and bring them into that pitiful cult. How is this not hateful? My faith is the older. It’s more established. Yet day after day I have to listen to false prophet Jesus lovers tell me I am a monster because I haven’t been dumb enough to be duped by their church’s greedy message of prejudice and fear. I am a victim of the bible’s hate!”  Presley:  “What did the others say? I agree with them.”  These four women are the antithesis of our country’s values.

ec529d70,Pelosi Humiliated: Feds Handcuff ‘Irrational’ House Speaker While Raiding Her Office,"Nancy Pelosi got to feel like a common criminal today when she refused to comply with a standard search warrant. The FBI, in conjunction with the US Capitol Marshals Service, delivered the warrant to Pelosi’s office to search for “anything and everything pertinent to the investigation into the Deep State shadow government.”  Pelosi, who was already drunk by 9 AM, threw a little temper tantrum and had to be detained “for her own protection as well as those around her.” The warrant was executed and Pelosi was released without incident.  According to the Marshals’ office, they logged 14 boxes of material evidence deemed to be conducive to the ongoing investigation. The Justice Department hasn’t commented, as they’re concerned about leaks from deeply embedded agents from the Obama Administration. The evidence is said to be even more proof that the democrats are the corrupt ones, including some recordings of Hillary Clinton admitting she hired James Comey.  Pelosi may be implicated personally for collusion with a foreign enemy if the ties between the Clintons and Ukraine can be confirmed. There’s also speculation that Pelosi may have had a record of the Uranium One transaction that proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that Hillary sold 20 percent of our country’s nuclear weapons fuel to Russia.  How many Democrats will go down in flames from this last round of search warrants? Plenty, says a spokesman fur John Durham:  “We’ve collected evidence of 17 felonies on the part of Pelosi’s staff, and we’ll be pushing them to talk with immunity agreements. Those who won’t cooperate will find themselves getting used to the weather in Guantanimo Bay.”  The entire ordeal lasted more than 3 hours, with Pelosi complaining the whole time. Her team is now working feverishly to try to have the picture of her in handcuffs deleted from the internet using a House rule that protects her from being slandered in public with ridiculous lies and conspiracy theories. Not that she has a case, since all of this seems to be true.  We’ll keep you updated on this developing story.",false
53bd8a53,Unusual Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Suggesting Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Than Natural Evolution and Delineation of Its Probable Synthetic Route,"September 14, 2020 Journal article Open Access  Unusual Features of the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Suggesting Sophisticated Laboratory Modification Rather Than Natural Evolution and Delineation of Its Probable Synthetic Route  Yan, Li-Meng; Kang, Shu; Guan, Jie; Hu, Shanchang  The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has led to over 910,000 deaths worldwide and unprecedented decimation of the global economy. Despite its tremendous impact, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has remained mysterious and controversial. The natural origin theory, although widely accepted, lacks substantial support. The alternative theory that the virus may have come from a research laboratory is, however, strictly censored on peer-reviewed scientific journals. Nonetheless, SARS-CoV-2 shows biological characteristics that are inconsistent with a naturally occurring, zoonotic virus. In this report, we describe the genomic, structural, medical, and literature evidence, which, when considered together, strongly contradicts the natural origin theory. The evidence shows that SARS-CoV-2 should be a laboratory product created by using bat coronaviruses ZC45 and/or ZXC21 as a template and/or backbone. Building upon the evidence, we further postulate a synthetic route for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the laboratory-creation of this coronavirus is convenient and can be accomplished in approximately six months. Our work emphasizes the need for an independent investigation into the relevant research laboratories. It also argues for a critical look into certain recently published data, which, albeit problematic, was used to support and claim a natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. From a public health perspective, these actions are necessary as knowledge of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and of how the virus entered the human population are of pivotal importance in the fundamental control of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as in preventing similar, future pandemics.",false
ff9fb688,Tenney Speaks on Tax Bill,"UTICA- Early Saturday morning the U.S. Senate passed their version of the tax reform bill. Vice President Mike Pence announced the final vote to be 51 to 49 in favor to passing the bill.  The initial bill passed through the House of Representatives in November. Local New Hartford congresswoman Claudia Tenney worked first hand with the bill for the past several months.  She said the initial blueprint to the bill was unacceptable and needed to be refined.  “We were able to get a ten thousand dollar deduction for property tax, which in our area would cover houses which cost up to three hundred and fifty thousand dollars” said Tenney.  She said this deduction is for those state employees such as firefighters and police officers who are retired and live off a pension. Tenney said this is what led her to vote “yes” on the bill.  Tenney also said, for middle class Americans this potential tax cut could be tremendous. Tenney mentioned, the Child Care Tax Credit which has been increased to $1,600 per child, however she said she hopes this section of the bill will be increased even further to $2,500.  “It isn’t where I would like to see it,” said Tenney. “There were some things I liked in the House bill that weren’t in the senate bill and some things I liked in the Senate bill that weren’t in the House bill.”  The next plan in the process is for both the senate and the house to meet tomorrow to start the compromising process.  “It’s going to be a very contentious next few weeks to get this passed before Christmas, but I do believe were on track to get it done,” said Tenney.",partially false
bda56511,Up to 90% of people who test positive for Covid barely carry any virus & are not contagious. Every stat about the disease is bogus,"By Peter Andrews , Irish science journalist and writer based in London. He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics  It has been revealed that the standard tests being used in the US to diagnose Covid-19 cases are far too sensitive, with the vast majority of people marked down as being positive actually turning out to be negative.  Top US virologists have been stunned by revelations about the laxity of the US Covid testing regimen. It turns out that tests that deliver a simple binary “positive or negative” result are not fit for purpose, as they tell us nothing about the contagiousness of each person.  Data from three US states – New York, Nevada and Massachusetts – shows that when the amount of the virus found in a person is taken into account, up to 90 percent of people who have tested positive should actually have been negative, as they are carrying only tiny amounts of the virus, are not contagious, pose no risk to others, and have no need to isolate.  This means that only a fraction of the daily “cases” being reported so hysterically in the mainstream media are actual, bona fide Covid-19 sufferers, and need treatment and to separate themselves from others.  Also on rt.com White House rejects ‘corrupt’ WHO concerns over Covid-19 vaccine development  It’s a sensitive issue  So how could this have happened? The answer has to do with the sensitivity of PCR Polymerase chain reaction tests for Covid, which it turns out can be ramped up according to the taste of the testing companies. Most testing companies have chosen the outrageously high sensitivity limit of 40 PCR cycles – meaning that the DNA in a sample is exponentially increased 40 times in order to amplify its signal.  Read more  But using such a ridiculously sensitive test means that the faintest traces of a dead virus, or even leftovers from previous infections, can result in a positive. Professor Juliet Morrison, a University of California virologist, said that even a limit of 35 PCR cycles is too high, let alone 40. She said she was “shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive.” But apparently, pretty much everyone in the US Covid brain trust took exactly that on faith.  So the scale of the pandemic ‘problem’ is actually much smaller than we’ve been led to believe – about a tenth of what all the politicians and media have been using to justify the lockdowns, the quarantines, the mass testing. Some may be shocked that the scale of the problem is so much smaller than assumed. But for a seasoned ignorer of any and all statistics that contain Covid ‘cases’, there are no surprises here. The truth is, there was never any reason to be confident in such figures. The FDA has only now been forced to concede that they have no idea how different testing companies determine which the positive and negative tests are: they just accept whatever data they are given.  What these findings bring is absolute assurance that the testing to this point has been an utter waste of time, and that not one statistic concerning this pandemic – from cases to deaths to infection rates – can be believed. But it should not have taken some journalist to ask the right question to discover this: a bit of common sense would have been enough. What is it going to take for these professional virologists to drop their assumptions and models, and just start acting based on the facts at hand?  Also on rt.com We might have to wait forever for science to show the Covid threat is over, so let’s use our common sense & get back to normal  Scrap test and trace  It’s a virus so deadly, you need a test to tell whether you have it or not. So goes the refrain of many lockdown skeptics, Covidiots and anti-maskers, of whom I am an indignant supporter. Something has gone… not just wrong, but totally haywire... when the might of the world’s scientific establishment is trained with the zeal of a Witchfinder General on one particular microscopic particle. Not even a particularly dangerous particle; the latest data show it is the eighth most common cause of death in England, and it doesn’t make the top ten in Wales.  Meanwhile, in Wuhan, the original source of this disease, the pool parties are in full swing. They don’t seem to be too worried about PCR tests or contact tracing, or even the virus itself. The Chinese government says that their supreme lockdown was so awesome that they now have zero Covid: a biological impossibility. Maybe they just stopped testing, and decided to get on with their lives. Everyone else should take a leaf out of their book.  Think your friends would be interested? Share this story!",false

6f6addcc,Marine Corps. Rebukes Pelosi: “WE DON’T WORK FOR YOU!”,"General David H. Berger, Commandant of the United States Marine Corps., refused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s request to use the Corps. to safeguard Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration from Trump supporters and insurrectionists.  A Pentagon source speaking under promise of anonymity told Real Raw News that Pelosi contacted Gen. Berger late Monday night, and she beseeched him to commit 5,000 troops to help ensure a peaceful transition of power and to prevent a repeat of the Jan 6 siege of the Capitol. Gen. Berger, our source said, didn’t understand why Pelosi needed additional soldiers to augment an already impressive force assembled by federal and state officials. That force includes 15,000 National Guard from D.C., Delaware, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and an undisclosed number of FBI and DHS agents who arrived in D.C. Sunday night.  Pelosi said she wanted “battle ready” reinforcements because “radicalized Trump supporters and kooky Qanon conspiracy people” were about to converge on D.C. She implored him to reconsider, arguing that it was the general’s patriotic duty to quell uprisings and guarantee Biden’s ascension to the Oval Office.  Her statement made the general explode, our source said.  “Don’t lecture me on patriotism, Madam Speaker. I’ve served this country with distinction for 40 years. I’ve spilled blood for our nation. What have you, a self-serving elected official, done for your country?” Gen. Berger said.  Pelosi further enraged him by saying he was answerable to Congress.  “I answer only to the president, and as I understand it, Donald J. Trump is still president and commander-in-chief. I abide in the Constitution as it was written, not your interpretation of it,” Gen. Berger admonished Pelosi.  Quoting our source, “When her intimidation tactic failed to sway Gen. Berger, Pelosi tried a different tactic: Begging and flattery.”  Pelosi claimed that the National Guard’s “weekend warriors” were ill-prepared to repel an army of “mad Trumpists.” Battle-hardened marines, however, were more capable of defeating “rabble rousers,” she said. “You have the best trained soldiers in the world, and America needs them.”  Gen. Berger was unmoved. The only way Marines would be deployed, he told her, was if President Trump himself issued that order.  “If you want us to help combat his supporters, I suggest you get him on the phone and tell him that.

fb157d73,NBA Players Wear Special Lace Collars To Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"NBA Players Wear Special Lace Collars To Honor Ruth Bader Ginsburg  LOS ANGELES, CA—NBA players are honoring the life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week by wearing pretty lace collars just like Notorious RBG used to wear. In a touching show of respect for the late Justice Ginsburg, and in solidarity with her progressive cause, Lebron James and the LA Lakers took to the court yesterday wearing a stunning variety of delicate white collars inspired by RBG's wardrobe.  According to several commentators on ESPN, the virtual teleconference crowd fell silent in reverent awe as the players all knelt down and chanted RBG! RBG! RBG!  Yeah, RBG was an amazing person, said LeBron James after the game. I have her biography right here and I totally read it right before the game. She was a judge. That's cool, I respect that. Judges judge things and not everyone can do that. She believed in Black Lives Matter and being on the right side of history and stuff.  Power forward Anthony Davis also expressed his happiness with the collars. It's good to honor her today with these lacey things. Commissioner Adam Silver and President Xi Jinping told us to wear them so we did. I just took this little doily thing from under a table lamp at my mom's house and cut a hole in the middle. Easy.  NBA players are vowing to wear the collars until Trump is removed from office, or until angry rioters burn their basketball arenas down, whichever comes first.

f3d06c7d,Record rise in NHS dissatisfaction levels - survey says,"The biggest ever rise in public dissatisfaction with the NHS was recorded last year, according to a long-running survey.  The British Social Attitudes Survey has been tracking satisfaction since 1983.  The 2015 poll of nearly 2,200 people showed satisfaction with the NHS at 60% - down from a peak of 70% in 2010.  Some 23% said they were actively dissatisfied - a rise of eight percentage points on the year before and the biggest single jump in a year. Graph on NHS satisfaction  Waiting times were cited as the biggest reason for dissatisfaction - mentioned by over half of people - followed by there being not enough staff.  The findings come amid growing pressure on waiting times for cancer care, A&E and routine operations, such as knee and hip operations.  Patients reported highest satisfaction rates for GP services and lowest for social care, which is run by local authorities and covers home help for tasks such as washing and dressing, and care homes.  The survey - carried out by NatCen Social Research - covered Scotland, Wales and England. The differences between the three nations were not considered to be statistically significant. Graph on NHS satisfaction Graph on NHS satisfaction  Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund think-tank, said that while overall satisfaction levels were still high by historical standards, the findings should act as a real wake up call.  What's gone wrong is the public's perception of the NHS under growing pressure. Money is tight, waiting times are getting longer, people are concerned that when they need the NHS it might not be there for them.  Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, agreed the public needed reassurance about the future of the NHS.  But he said the most important set of results were on social care. He said the satisfaction levels were deeply concerning and said the system needed greater funding.  A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said: There is pressure on the NHS as our population ages, and that's why the government is investing record amounts to transform care.  A Welsh government spokesman said it too was increasing the budget, and ministers were working hard to improve patient care, while the Scottish Health Secretary Shona Robison said ministers were always open to patient feedback.

907e767b,Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now,"If you stack up the orange bars until 1/22, you get 444 cases. Now add up all the grey bars. They add up to ~12,000 cases. So when Wuhan thought it had 444 cases, it had 27 times more. If France thinks it has 1,400 cases, it might well have tens of thousands  The same math applies to Paris. With ~30 cases inside the city, the true number of cases is likely to be in the hundreds, maybe thousands. With 300 cases in the Ile-de-France region, the total cases in the region might already exceed tens of thousands.  Spain and Madrid  Spain has very similar numbers as France 1,200 cases vs. 1,400, and both have 30 deaths. That means the same rules are valid: Spain has probably upwards of 20k true cases already.  In the Comunidad de Madrid region, with 600 official cases and 17 deaths, the true number of cases is likely between 10,000 and 60,000.  If you read these data and tell yourself: “Impossible, this can’t be true”, just think this: With this number of cases, Wuhan was already in lockdown.  With the number of cases we see today in countries like the US, Spain, France, Iran, Germany, Japan, Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden or Switzerland, Wuhan was already in lockdown.  And if you’re telling yourself: “Well, Hubei is just one region”, let me remind you that it has nearly 60 million people, bigger than Spain and about the size of France.  2. What Will Happen When These Coronavirus Cases Materialize?  So the coronavirus is already here. It’s hidden, and it’s growing exponentially.  What will happen in our countries when it hits? It’s easy to know, because we already have several places where it’s happening. The best examples are Hubei and Italy.  Fatality Rates  The World Health Organization WHO quotes 3.4% as the fatality rate % people who contract the coronavirus and then die. This number is out of context so let me explain it.  It really depends on the country and the moment: between 0.6% in South Korea and 4.4% in Iran. So what is it? We can use a trick to figure it out.  The two ways you can calculate the fatality rate is Deaths/Total Cases and Death/Closed Cases. The first one is likely to be an underestimate, because lots of open cases can still end up in death. The second is an overestimate, because it’s likely that deaths are closed quicker than recoveries.  What I did was look at how both evolve over time. Both of these numbers will converge to the same result once all cases are closed, so if you project past trends to the future, you can make a guess on what the final fatality rate will be.  This is what you see in the data. China’s fatality rate is now between 3.6% and 6.1%. If you project that in the future, it looks like it converges towards ~3.8%-4%. This is double the current estimate, and 30 times worse than the flu.  It is made up of two completely different realities though: Hubei and the rest of China.  Hubei’s fatality rate will probably converge towards 4.8%. Meanwhile, for the rest of China, it will likely converge to ~0.9%:  I also charted the numbers for Iran, Italy and South Korea, the only countries with enough deaths to make this somewhat relevant.  Iran’s and Italy’s Deaths / Total Cases are both converging towards the 3%-4% range. My guess is their numbers will end up around that figure too.  South Korea is the most interesting example, because these 2 numbers are completely disconnected: deaths / total cases is only 0.6%, but deaths / closed cases is a whopping 48%. My take on it is that a few unique things are happening there. First, they’re testing everybody with so many open cases, the death rate seems low, and leaving the cases open for longer so they close cases quickly when the patient is dead. Second, they have a lot of hospital beds see chart 17.b. There might also be other reasons we don’t know. What is relevant is that deaths/cases has hovered around 0.5% since the beginning, suggesting it will stay there, likely heavily influenced by the healthcare system and crisis management.  The last relevant example is the Diamond Princess cruise: with 706 cases, 6 deaths and 100 recoveries, the fatality rate will be between 1% and 6.5%.  Note that the age distribution in each country will also have an impact: Since mortality is much higher for older people, countries with an aging population like Japan will be harder hit on average than younger countries like Nigeria. There are also weather factors, especially humidity and temperature, but it’s still unclear how this will impact transmission and fatality rates.  This is what you can conclude:  Excluding these, countries that are prepared will see a fatality rate of ~0.5% South Korea to 0.9% rest of China.  Countries that are overwhelmed will have a fatality rate between ~3%-5%  Put in another way: Countries that act fast can reduce the number of deaths by a factor of ten. And that’s just counting the fatality rate. Acting fast also drastically reduces the cases, making this even more of a no-brainer.  Countries that act fast reduce the number of deaths at least by 10x.  So what does a country need to be prepared?  What Will Be the Pressure on the System  Around 20% of cases require hospitalization, 5% of cases require the Intensive Care Unit ICU, and around 2.5% require very intensive help, with items such as ventilators or ECMO extra-corporeal oxygenation.  The problem is that items such as ventilators and ECMO can’t be produced or bought easily. A few years ago, the US had a total of 250 ECMO machines, for example.  So if you suddenly have 100,000 people infected, many of them will want to go get tested. Around 20,000 will require hospitalization, 5,000 will need the ICU, and 1,000 will need machines that we don’t have enough of today. And that’s just with 100,000 cases.  That is without taking into account issues such as masks. A country like the US has only 1% of the masks it needs to cover the needs of its healthcare workers 12M N95, 30M surgical vs. 3.5B needed. If a lot of cases appear at once, there will be masks for only 2 weeks.  Countries like Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong or Singapore, as well as Chinese regions outside of Hubei, have been prepared and given the care that patients need.  But the rest of Western countries are rather going in the direction of Hubei and Italy. So what is happening there?  What an Overwhelmed Healthcare System Looks Like  The stories that happened in Hubei and those in Italy are starting to become eerily similar. Hubei built two hospitals in ten days, but even then, it was completely overwhelmed.  Both complained that patients inundated their hospitals. They had to be taken care of anywhere: in hallways, in waiting rooms…  I heavily recommend this short Twitter thread. It paints a pretty stark picture of Italy today  Healthcare workers spend hours in a single piece of protective gear, because there’s not enough of them. As a result, they can’t leave the infected areas for hours. When they do, they crumble, dehydrated and exhausted. Shifts don’t exist anymore. People are driven back from retirement to cover needs. People who have no idea about nursing are trained overnight to fulfill critical roles. Everybody is on call, always.  Francesca Mangiatordi, an Italian nurse that crumbled in the middle of the war with the Coronavirus  That is, until they become sick. Which happens a lot, because they’re in constant exposure to the virus, without enough protective gear. When that happens, they need to be in quarantine for 14 days, during which they can’t help. Best case scenario, 2 weeks are lost. Worst case, they’re dead.  The worst is in the ICUs, when patients need to share ventilators or ECMOs. These are in fact impossible to share, so the healthcare workers must determine what patient will use it. That really means, which one lives and which one dies.  “After a few days, we have to choose. […] Not everyone can be intubated. We decide based on age and state of health.” —Christian Salaroli, Italian MD.  Medical workers wear protective suits to attend to people sickened by the novel coronavirus, in the intensive care unit of a designated hospital in Wuhan, China, on Feb. 6. China Daily/Reuters, via Washington Post  All of this is what drives a system to have a fatality rate of ~4% instead of ~0.5%. If you want your city or your country to be part of the 4%, don’t do anything today.  Satellite images show Behesht Masoumeh cemetery in the Iranian city of Qom. Photograph: ©2020 Maxar Technologies. Via The Guardian and the The New York Times.  3. What Should You Do?  Flatten the Curve  This is a pandemic now. It can’t be eliminated. But what we can do is reduce its impact.  Some countries have been exemplary at this. The best one is Taiwan, which is extremely connected with China and yet still has as of today fewer than 50 cases. This recent paper explain all the measures they took early on, which were focused on containment.  They have been able to contain it, but most countries lacked this expertise and didn’t. Now, they’re playing a different game: mitigation. They need to make this virus as inoffensive as possible.  If we reduce the infections as much as possible, our healthcare system will be able to handle cases much better, driving the fatality rate down. And, if we spread this over time, we will reach a point where the rest of society can be vaccinated, eliminating the risk altogether. So our goal is not to eliminate coronavirus contagions. It’s to postpone them.  The more we postpone cases, the better the healthcare system can function, the lower the mortality rate, and the higher the share of the population that will be vaccinated before it gets infected.  How do we flatten the curve?  Social Distancing  There is one very simple thing that we can do and that works: social distancing.  If you go back to the Wuhan graph, you will remember that as soon as there was a lockdown, cases went down. That’s because people didn’t interact with each other, and the virus didn’t spread.  The current scientific consensus is that this virus can be spread within 2 meters 6 feet if somebody coughs. Otherwise, the droplets fall to the ground and don’t infect you.  The worst infection then becomes through surfaces: The virus survives for up to 9 days on different surfaces such as metal, ceramics and plastics. That means things like doorknobs, tables, or elevator buttons can be terrible infection vectors.  The only way to truly reduce that is with social distancing: Keeping people home as much as possible, for as long as possible until this recedes.  This has already been proven in the past. Namely, in the 1918 flu pandemic.  Learnings from the 1918 Flu Pandemic  You can see how Philadelphia didn’t act quickly, and had a massive peak in death rates. Compare that with St Louis, which did.  Then look at Denver, which enacted measures and then loosened them. They had a double peak, with the 2nd one higher than the first.  If you generalize, this is what you find:  This chart shows, for the 1918 flu in the US, how many more deaths there were per city depending on how fast measures were taken. For example, a city like St Louis took measures 6 days before Pittsburgh, and had less than half the deaths per citizen. On average, taking measures 20 days earlier halved the death rate.  Italy has finally figured this out. They first locked down Lombardy on Sunday, and one day later, on Monday, they realized their mistake and decided they had to lock down the entire country.  Hopefully, we will see results in the coming days. However, it will take one to two weeks to see. Remember the Wuhan graph: there was a delay of 12 days between the moment when the lockdown was announced and the moment when official cases orange started going down.  How Can Politicians Contribute to Social Distancing?  The question politicians are asking themselves today is not whether they should do something, but rather what’s the appropriate action to take.  There are several stages to control an epidemic, starting with anticipation and ending with eradication. But it’s too late for most options today. With this level of cases, the only options politicians have in front of them are containment, mitigation or suppression.  Containment  Containment is making sure all the cases are identified, controlled, and isolated. It’s what Singapore, South Korea or Taiwan are doing so well: They very quickly limit people coming in, identify the sick, immediately isolate them, use heavy protective gear to protect their health workers, track all their contacts, quarantine them… This works extremely well when you’re prepared and you do it early on, and don’t need to grind your economy to a halt to make it happen.  I’ve already touted Taiwan’s approach. But China’s is good too. The lengths at which it went to contain the virus are mind-boggling. For example, they had up to 1,800 teams of 5 people each tracking every infected person, everybody they got interacted with, then everybody those people interacted with, and isolating the bunch. That’s how they were able to contain the virus across a billion-people country.  This is not what Western countries have done. And now it’s too late. The recent US announcement that most travel from Europe was banned is a containment measure for a country that has, as of today, 3 times the cases that Hubei had when it shut down, growing exponentially. How can we know if it’s enough? It turns out, we can know by looking at the Wuhan travel ban.",true
402cad4f,Exclusive: The TCF Center Election Fraud – Newly Discovered Video Shows Late Night Deliveries of Tens of Thousands of Illegal Ballots 8 Hours After Deadline,"By Cassandra Fairbanks and Jim Hoft  On Tuesday, November 3rd President Trump was ahead of Joe Biden in the swing state of Michigan by over 100,000 votes. This appeared to be another solid win for President Trump in Michigan with a greater margin than his 2016 victory. The ballot counting in Detroit, Michigan on election night took place at the TCF Center, formerly known as Cobo Hall.  This is the site where Detroit City Officials put cardboard over the windows to prevent the GOP observers from seeing in, where poll workers were militantly hostile to the GOP observers, and where hundreds of affidavits by election observers claim they witnessed voter fraud.  At least three election observers testified in sworn affidavits that they witnessed vehicles delivering fraudulent ballots to the TCF Center early in the morning on November 4th.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  Michigander Shane Trejo witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop that gave Joe Biden an outstanding lift. “There were thousands of ballots in each box,” Trejo says. “There were at least 50 boxes that I saw unloaded at 3:30 am, well after the 8:00 pm deadline for ballots to show up.”  The 3:30 am was the first ballot delivery since 10:30 pm when 138,000 ballots showed up suddenly. Shane later testified that he noticed that the city of Detroit Clerk’s Office and its emblem were written on the white van that showed up with the ballots. City Clerk Janice Winfrey‘s name was on the van and a number presumably for Janet Winfrey’s office. Trejo says the ballots could not be processed when they arrived, so by the time they were counted, a new shift of poll workers had come in for the day.  After these ballot drops Joe Biden took the lead in Michigan.  Shane Trejo explained how the timing was important. The Biden Ballot Drop took place at the end of one shift. The ballots were left uncounted. So when the new shift came to count ballots they didn’t know where the ballots had come from.  Trejo repeatedly asked about this truck to site supervisors and was STONEWALLED.  Former Michigan State Senator Pat Colbeck was also present at the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th. Senator Colbeck also witnessed the 3:30 am Biden Ballot Drop. Colbeck spoke with The Gateway Pundit back in November, “I went back there and I witnessed a mini-panel truck if you will with a Detroit Election Bureau regalia all over the side and a vehicle ID number on it… And inside of it, and this gets into some chain of custody discussions, there was no indication that there was a Republican and a Democrat present during transfer. We don’t know if they stopped by a sidestreet in Coney Island and picked up a few more ballots during transfer. We have no way of verifying any of that information.”  The authorities and media in Michigan were completely uninterested in following up on this shocking story.  Until today, no one has bothered to review the video footage from the TCF Center on election night.  The Gateway Pundit requested the TCF video back in December!  The TCF Center tried to quote us over $22,000 for one day’s worth of video.  We requested two hours of video.  Last Friday we were sent the requested video.  Since last week we have been combing through the hundreds of hours of security camera footage from the TCF Center on the morning of November 4th.  And what we found is a political bombshell.  ** At 3:23 AM The Gateway Pundit has exclusive video of a white van registered to the city of Detroit entering the gate into the TCF Center.  ** At 3:25 AM we discovered video from a second camera showing three individuals unloading over 50 boxes of ballots in a hallway inside the TCF Building and just outside the counting room.  ** The ballots were then wheeled away on carts into the ballot counting room.  ** The van is then seen on video leaving the center about 25 minutes later.  ** Then we saw the van returning an hour later, entering the TCF Center again and unloading more boxes of ballots.  ** The white van was escorted by a black sports car for both ballot deliveries.  ** The white van was allowed through an electronic gate to enter the TCF complex.  This is video proof of the fraud in Detroit, Michigan. It is exactly as the GOP observers described it to us back in November!  We have more damning video from the TCF Center to release in the coming days.

c5bc6ccd,Grandparents blocked from adopting granddaughter hit out at 'wicked' treatment,"The grandparents of a three-year-old girl have been blocked from adopting her because they are ‘too old’, it emerged last night.  They had been left in charge of the child after her mother – who has a history of mental health problems – was sectioned.  But the youngster, their only grandchild, was taken away from them and handed to foster parents.  Cuddles: The three-year-old girl, left, with her grandmother, right, faces have been pixelated for legal reasons  The adoption will go ahead on July 31 unless they win the right to appeal.  The grandmother, 58, and grandfather, 70, have even been told by social workers to mark the occasion with a ‘party’ and bring a cake – a suggestion they described as ‘insulting’.  If the appeal fails the only contact they will have with their granddaughter is two letters they are allowed to send each year until she is 18.  Their daughter will be allowed to see photos of her once a year but cannot keep copies.  Last night the ‘emotionally traumatised’ grandmother, a shop assistant, said: ‘I don’t feel old at all. I work two days a week. It’s just awful they could take her away from us.  ‘It is devastating and so silly. Women have children older and older these days anyway.’  Close: The little girl with her grandfather in a pirate hat. The retired firefighter says the family has been 'kicked in the teeth'  The grandfather, a retired firefighter, described his family’s treatment as ‘wicked’ and said he was amazed it could happen ‘in a civilised society’.  ‘We would be 100 per cent capable of caring for her and we would be over the moon to have her,' he said.  We have been kicked in the teeth by social workers. It is shocking they have that much power to take a family apart Grandfather, 70, retired firefighter  ‘But we have been kicked in the teeth by social workers. It is shocking they have that much power to take a family apart.’  Many women older than 58 have become mothers around the world and Britain’s oldest mother, Sue Tollefsen, gave birth to her only child, Freya, in 2008 when she was 57.  The girl at the centre of the adoption wrangle, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was born to the couple’s daughter, who is now in her 30s and is no longer in a relationship with the girl’s father. The child’s mother was sectioned in January after self-harming.  One week later, a social worker appeared at the grandparents’ home in Shoeburyness, Essex, demanding they hand the child over.  They did not see her again until March and even then were allowed to see her only once a week.  The grandfather said: ‘A social worker came round saying she’d come to pick up her clothes because they were taking her into foster care.  Southend-on-Sea Borough Council pictured above has put the child up for adoption and a lawyer who has taken on the case expressed concern that workers were 'pursuing adoption targets that generate income'  'We didn’t know what was going on but they’d applied for a court order with a view to adoption.’  The social worker showed them a form which they have since learned the mother had been persuaded to sign from her specialist mental health hospital bed – with no legal representative present – consenting to her daughter being taken into care.  THE BIAS OF SOCIAL WORKERS: GRANDPARENTS' BATTLE TO BRING UP CHILDREN AND THE OBSTACLES THEY FACE Grandparents are legally allowed to bring up children in place of the parents – but can face obstacles when social workers become involved. The Children Act of 1989 says that ‘private fostering’ – which is an informal arrangement with the parents – does not need to be reported to social workers or considered by a court if the carers are close relatives, including grandparents. Grandparents can choose to go to court to get an adoption order so that they are legally responsible for their grandchild without needing the approval of a state-recognised adoption agency. They can also take out a Special Guardianship order, which means the child remains formally under control of his or her natural parents, but is legally in the everyday charge of the guardian. But if social workers are involved in the case, they can rule that the grandparents are ‘unfit’ to bring up the child – and it seems they are often quick to do so. Last year a family court judge publicly condemned social workers who he said were ‘visibly biased’ against the grandparents of a two-year-old boy. Advertisement  At Chelmsford family court on June 17, a judge ruled adoption should go ahead but the grandparents could not be candidates.  They attended court but were unable to argue their case as they could not afford legal representation.  Grandparents are not entitled to legal aid in care cases. The assessment claiming they are not suitable to care for the toddler is not available to the public.  But the Daily Mail understands it claimed the couple would be incapable of acting as her guardians when she reached adolescence.  It initially gave their ages incorrectly. The error was corrected but the judge said they were too old as the grandfather would be 82 and the grandmother 70 when the girl turned 15.  The couple said they were also accused of not caring for their own daughter properly, a claim never previously made.  A lawyer who has now taken up their case pro bono yesterday expressed concern that social workers at Southend Council were pursuing adoption targets that generate income.  Karina Chetwynd, of John Copland and Son solicitors, said: ‘In my view, adoption is a cash cow. There is a lot of money paid for each adoption and each local authority has targets.’  Miss Chetwynd is hoping to be granted the right to appeal by arguing that the grandparents’ human rights were breached and they are entitled to a fair hearing and to a family life.  Anne Jones, the Southend councillor responsible for child welfare, said: ‘Age is not the deciding factor in our assessments. We have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of the children.",false

The U.K. Sun reported that this claim was made by Giuffre in a manuscript of a book called “The Billionaire’s Playboy Club.” Giuffre wrote that Maxwell “enjoyed to boast about her rendezvous with numerous lovers”.  “When she came back giddy as a schoolgirl with an explosion of news, with all the develop up and enjoyment in her voice you ‘d think she was the next crown princess,” Giuffre composed. “But she had actually offered George Cooney a b ***** b in the restroom at some random occasion. She never let that one down.”  Clooney has yet to talk about the claims made by Giuffre, who has actually also claimed that she was required to have sex with Prince Andrew on three different occasions. In this exact same manuscript, Giuffre explained the supposed fetishes of the British royal.  “He liked my feet and even licked in between my toes,”Giuffre wrote of Andrew. Nevertheless, she went on to claim that “there was the lack of passion in the intimacy we shared, to him I was simply another lady, and to me, he was simply another job.”Epstein committed suicide in federal custody last summer while awaiting trial on various sex charges. Maxwell was jailed last month, and she has actually been remanded to a prison in New york city City up until her trial, which is arranged to occur next July. A judge purchased the 58-year-old British socialite to be remanded after figuring out that she positioned a considerable flight danger, offered her immense wealth and global connections.  Giuffre has actually implicated Maxwell of personally undressing her when she initially fulfilled Epstein as a teen.  “I was so scared thinking about disturbing and frustrating them, I do not know, it’s a strange situation without a doubt and I was anticipated to lick his nipples … and give him foreplay while he desired to fondle me,” she said. “Then at the end, I was told by Ghislaine to get on leading and straddle Jeffrey sexually, and when we were done, we went and had a shower in the room and Jeffrey told me to wash him up and down.”  This piece originally appeared in UpliftingToday.com and is utilized by approval.

99e1ce77,Wisconsin Election Commission Directive Allows Clerks To ‘Fix’ Ballots [UPDATED],"This article has been updated to include more context about the directive as well as the commission’s defense of its policy. A new report points out that an executive branch agency called the Wisconsin Election Commission issued a directive in October telling local county election clerks that they can “fix” ballots by filling in missing addresses for witnesses. According to one former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice, the policy, which has been in place since October 2016, may violate a Wisconsin law requiring ballots to have a witness address to be validated. The commission has defended its policy, however, stating that the law “does not specify who affixes the address.” Wisconsin Statute 6.876d states, “If a certificate is missing the address of a witness, the ballot may not be counted.” But in August, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a memo telling clerks they could fill in the address of the voter: To make sure your ballot is counted, double check the following before you return it: Your voter information: this section is usually completed by your clerk and includes the date of the election, the county and municipality in which you are registered, your name, the address where you are registered, city, and zip code. Voter Signature: you or your assistant must sign in the Certification of Voter section. Witness Signature and Address: your witness must sign and provide their full address, street number, street name, city in the Certification of Witness section. Make sure your ballot is in your envelope and make sure the envelope is sealed properly. If any of the required information above is missing, your ballot will not be counted. In October, the Wisconsin Elections Commission issued a directive to the state’s county clerks that seemed to allow them to fix incomplete or “spoiled” ballots missing witness signatures, writing, “Please note that the clerk should attempt to resolve any missing witness address information prior to Election Day if possible and this can be done through reliable information personal knowledge, voter registration information, through a phone call with the voter or witness. The witness does not need to appear to add a missing address.” As noted by Wisconsin Election Commission public information officer Reid Magney, the guidance has been in place since October 2016. “The guidance has been in effect for 11 statewide elections, including the 2016 presidential and presidential recount, and no one has objected to it until now,” said Magney, as reported by USA Today. An Oct. 18, 2016 memo from the commission reads in part formatting adjusted: [T]he Commission’s guidance is that municipal clerks shall do all that they can reasonably do to obtain any missing part of the witness address. Those steps may include one or more of the following options: 1. The clerk is able to reasonably discern the missing address or address component by information appearing on the envelope or from some other source, such as: The voter has provided his or her complete address and the clerk has personal knowledge that the witness resides at the same address as the voter. The clerk has personal knowledge of the witness and knows his/or her address. The voter’s complete address appears on the address label, and the witness indicates the same street address as the voter. The clerk is able to utilize lists or databases at his or her disposal to determine the witness’s address. 2. The voter or witness may wish to appear in person to add the missing information, or provide the address information by phone, fax, email or mail. The voter may provide the address separately as an alternative to returning the certificate envelope and having the voter mail it back again as outlined below. 3. The voter may request that the clerk return the certificate envelope so the voter can personally add the witness address. […] 4. The voter may wish to spoil the original ballot and vote a new one. Derek Muller, a professor of law at the Iowa School of Law, told Just The News, “This is a complication thing about elections like this. I’ve seen it in a lot of jurisdictions, what might be sort of a technical violation of the statute, in this case encouragement to county clerks about how to use their judgment on whether or not to cure a ballot.” Retired Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman told WISN, “The statute is very, very clear. If an absentee ballot does not have a witness address on it, it’s not valid. That ballot is not valid.” “In defiance of and direct contradiction to the statute, the Wisconsin Elections Commission gave guidance — that is, cover —to all 72 county clerks and turned the statute on its head,” said Gableman. “They said, ‘Gee, we know the law says an absentee ballot without the witness address is not valid, but county clerk, you have a duty to go ahead and look up on your own the witness’ address if there’s no address on the absentee ballot.’” The Wisconsin Election Commission, however, maintains that its policies are not in violation of the law, asserting that the law “does not specify who affixes the address” and noting that the addresses have been added to the certificates rather than the ballots themselves, as AFP reports.

52d85928,Candace Owens Fired After Calling Kamala ‘Fake Black’,"One of the most popular pundits on cable news has been unceremoniously fired this week, after her parent network, One America News, was deluged with calls charging her with racism and “hate speech.” During a segment of her show critiquing the Democratic national convention, the dusky conservative spitfire referred to Vice Presidential candidate Kamala Harris as a “fake black.”  Owens is no stranger to controversy, previously angering American Jews and Israelis with favorable talk about Adolf Hitler. The fiery former pornography fluffer told Sandy Batt of Inside Trumptards magazine that her comments were strictly opinion and that OAN’s purpose isn’t news, but simply fictional entertainment for those even too stupid for Fox News.  “Like President Trump, I speak my mind. And like his majesty, I take absolutely no responsibility for it. I’m black. I’m like the one single black that conservatives like because they think that makes them non-racist. Go ahead, ask some tattered granny in West Methpipe, Alabama, to name a black person she likes. The 50% of the time they don’t say my name, it’s gonna be Sammy Davis Junior. So it’s probably a bad idea to fire me. They’re already going nuts trying to believe that Kamala is black. Who are they gonna replace me with? Diamond and Silk? Old white men can’t masturbate to those two linebackers. Now go buy my book. You can just leave it on the coffee table for when your grandkids stop by after doing something super Caucasian like shopping at Pier One Imports.”  Network executives have long been fielding demands to let go of Owens, and are reportedly overjoyed about the news of her departure. Several members of her former camera crew celebrated with a cake shaped like the talking head herself dressed and posed as infamous feline chef Carol Baskin.  Although many will be upset by the news of her shitcanning, it shouldn’t be long before Owens finds another outlet for her idiotic opinions and banter. Hey Candace – There’s always The Blaze.",false
88477948,HEY LOOK! Senator Tammy Baldwin Is Back In Wisconsin. Must Be An Election Year!,"Now that it’s 2018, an election year, I would like to welcome Senator Tammy Baldwin back to Wisconsin.  For the last 25 years, whenever an election approaches, Sen. Baldwin seems to begrudgingly leave her elitist donors on the coasts for Wisconsin. Almost overnight, after months and months away from her constituents, she tries to trick us into believing she’s spent the past two decades in Washington representing us, as opposed to representing donors in California and New York who try to impose their agenda on the Badger State.  Senator Baldwin has made this deceitful campaign of tricking the people of our great state her focus. Wisconsin deserves better, and voters won’t fall for it again.  This time around, the recently passed Republican tax bill provides voters with the perfect opportunity to hold Senator Baldwin and her Democrat colleagues accountable for their unwillingness to do what is right for the millions of Wisconsinites and Americans they claim to represent.  Senator Baldwin and her colleagues in Washington were given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform an outdated, broken and costly tax code that discouraged job growth and investment in America, failed to reward the middle-class or boost economic growth, and lined the pockets of Washington D.C. special interests, all at the expense of hard-working citizens and small businesses. She claims to support a “Buy America” philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words.  Instead of doing the right thing and voting for legislation that would have improved the lives of so many whose voices she is supposed to represent in Washington, Senator Baldwin did what she has done so often during her almost 30 years in public office: She played politics with the well-being and wallets of Wisconsin citizens. It was a desperate attempt to score cheap political points — and not so cheap campaign contributions — from her radical, far left supporters in faraway states.  Here in Wisconsin, it is estimated that a family of four will receive more than $2,500 per year in tax relief from the bill Senator Baldwin voted against. That extra $200 plus per month might not mean much to the liberal millionaires from New York and California whom she relies on to bankroll her campaigns, but it could change the lives of folks from Beloit to Superior, and everywhere in between.  Given the senator’s long history of only supporting policies championed by the far left and the coastal elite, it is no surprise she voted against a tax bill that will help so many Wisconsinites. In fact, she proudly joined large numbers from California, New York and New Jersey’s Congressional delegations in voting against more money in the pockets of Wisconsin families.  I have no doubt that Ms. Baldwin will soon be back to embark on one of her semiannual election-year tours, masquerading as “Wisconsin’s” senator. As she travels our great state, she ought to take the time and ask voters what they think about the extra income they’re receiving as a result of the tax bill. Senator Baldwin won’t like the answer, but least she’ll know a little bit more about the people of Wisconsin.  Wisconsin U.S. Senate candidate Leah Vukmir is a nurse, military mom and conservative with a proven record of reform. She currently serves as a state senator from Brookfield, Wisconsin.

5cc316ba,Study: Marijuana could be making teens less intelligent,"HOUSTON — In Texas, marijuana is illegal, and a Duke University study says using it can make you less smart.  For decades, researchers studied more than 1,000 people in New Zealand. They found teenagers who use marijuana at least four days a week lost 8 IQ points between the ages of 13 and 38.  Here's the key: that same thing didn't happen for people who heavily smoked marijuana only as adults. Heavy pot smokers did show deficits in memory, concentration and just overall brainpower. But all those effects were much worse among those who started lighting up as teens.  So is an 8-point IQ loss significant? Researchers say you bet. A person's long-term job prospects, job performance an income could be impacted, too.  Researchers can't say for certain marijuana is the sole reason those IQs took a hit. A competing study found a person's socioeconomic status could also be to blame for the IQ slide.  RELATED: Could marijuana law reform come to Texas this year?

cda49fa7,Merck Scraps COVID Vaccines; Says It’s More Effective To Get The Virus And Recover,"Vaccine manufacturer Merck has abandoned development of two coronavirus vaccines, saying that after extensive research it was concluded that the shots offered less protection than just contracting the virus itself and developing antibodies. The company announced that the shots V590 and V591 were ‘well tolerated’ by test patients, however they generated an ‘inferior’ immune system response in comparison with natural infection. The company stated that instead it will focus on research into therapeutic drugs labeled as MK-7110 and MK-4482. The drugs aim to protect patients from the damage of an overactive immune response to the virus. “Interim results from a Phase 3 study showed a greater than 50 percent reduction in the risk of death or respiratory failure in patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19,” the company’s statement noted of the MK-7110 drug. Merck is to receive around $356 million from the US government to fast-track production of the potential treatments under Operation Warp Speed. Chief Marketing Officer Michael Nally recently told Bloomberg that Merck is aiming to produce some 20 million courses of the MK-4482 drug, an oral antiviral which patients will take twice a day for five days. Meanwhile, in related news, German scientists have claimed that the UK Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is less than 8% effective in over 65s, prompting the vaccine developers to hit back, rubbishing the claims. The German media published the claims, alleging it had been ‘confirmed’ by ‘multiple’ unnamed senior German government sources. UK government ministers have suggested that the claim could be related to the ongoing dispute over delivery of the vaccine between the European Union and AstraZeneca. The EU, which is yet to approve the vaccine, has threatened to block exports of shots to Britain, in a move that has been branded ‘spiteful’ by British government sources. In an effort to make sure its member states get their ‘fair share’ of vaccines, the EU has also threatened to block the delivery of Pfizer vaccines to the UK, demanding that drug companies provide detailed information on when they plan to export Covid jabs to countries outside the bloc.",other

2e431d37,"COVID-19 No Vaccine Needed, There Is Already A Cure","Dr. Richard Bartlett, a Dallas MD who previously advised Governor Rick Perry for 7 years has a lifesaving COVID breakthrough, that Taiwan, Japan, Singapore and Iceland are also using. The breakthrough is an inexpensive generic drug used to help asthmatics for more than 20 years, but the US and most of the world’s governments are using the WHO’s blind acceptance of the failed China strategy.  The deaths in every state, and every country could almost stop overnight if health professionals changed course immediately. For some reason, the NIH and CDC want to act as slow as molasses, but a small number of doctors are already doing this with their patients and they are seeing immediate success.  Will it work for every single patient? That remains to be seen, but many people who have used this protocol saw immediate results. This is the same path taken by Taiwan 24 million people, 7 deaths, Japan 126 million, 977 deaths, Singapore 5.6 million, 26 deaths Iceland 341,000 population, 10 deaths.  The Doctor and His Successes  Dr. Richard Bartlett has been practicing in Texas for 28 years. Gov. Perry asked him to be on the Health Disparities Task Force for two years, and he stayed for seven years. He is a regular CBS-TV health expert. He is also a medical author, who undertakes medical missions around the world.  Dr Bartlett says he is giving his COVID-19 patients an inhaled steroid, a standard asthma treatment. Not only is this treatment working, he says many of his patients see immediate results. For best effect, this generic medicine is administered through a nebulizer machine, not an inhaler.  100% of Dr. Bartlett’s patients are alive, and he has been using it since March, almost four months.  The Virus and The Medicine  COVID is a respiratory inflammatory disease so an effective medicine must address respiratory inflammation.  The medicine used by Dr. Bartlett is administered as part of a trio. First, there is an inhaled asthma medication, a steroid that costs $200 for the complete treatment. It is administered through a nebulizer, and it takes about 5 minutes. In addition, Dr. Bartlett gives an antibiotic to protect from secondary infection of pneumonia, and also zinc, which fights against virus multiplication.  Here is how Dr. Bartlett explains it. “You plug in the machine, put the pre-mixed, pre-measured medicine from the pharmacy into the [machine] reservoir and push the ‘on’ button. You breathe it for 5 minutes.”  “Patients tell me they feel better during the first treatment. Their chest pain goes away. Their shortness of breath goes away. Then their fever breaks.”  This very safe medicine has been used on millions of people, including premature babies and also fragile people in nursing homes, for more than 20 years. It has no cardiac risk.  Why This Works  Dr. Bertlett says “COVID is a respiratory virus that goes into the lungs, and binds with ACE receptors in the lungs. That triggers a cytokine storm inflammatory chemicals and enzymes all over the body.”  COVID kills some people if they are not treated. 50% of people get COVID but they don’t even know. For the 20% at risk, there are treatments that are already valid and working. Unfortunately, there are also failed protocols that are being used and repeated, killing people who did not need to die, had the right approach been taken, as Dr. Bartlett’s work shows.  “There is a lot of research on this medicine already and it is very safe,” Dr. Bartlett says.  The Patients  One of Dr. Bartlett’s patients has 2 types of lymphoma and is on chemotherapy. After being in bed at home with a fever for 5 days, she called him and he started her on the treatment that night. By the morning, her fever broke. She recovered over the weekend and worked a full day on Monday, and has since had two negative COVID tests.  Another of his patients has a 50-year history of smoking, and had quadruple bypass surgery. Even with high blood pressure and thyroid disease, this patient also had a positive result.  Why Repeat The Failed China Strategy?  The failed China strategy is being followed because the World Health Organization is promoting it. Some countries have already realized the failure and changed to the same winning strategy used by Dr. Bartlett.  Although the treatment used by Dr. Bartlett, Singapore, Japan, and Taiwan works, and it is very low cost, the CDC and NIH allow very expensive experimental pharmaceuticals to be used by doctors.  The strategy Dr. Bartlett talks about is “Early Testing. Early Treatment.” This is the same strategy the U.S. uses for cancer, heart disease, stroke and other infections.  That is not the strategy promoted by WHO, which has praised the failed China strategy. Italy followed their strategy and more than 30,000 people died there.  The failed Chinese strategy is “wait until the house is burned 2/3 down and then seek help.” The USA, Australia , the UK and most other countries are currently using the failed China strategy of lockdown and late intervention. The US, at least has massively ramped up its testing regime.  Health Authority Advice  The advice of many health authorities is “Don’t seek help if you have mild-to-moderate symptoms. Wait until you have severe symptoms,” Dr Bartlett says.  Bartlett says some people go to the ER because they feel bad, but they are sent home with a positive test, and are told “Take Tylenol and tough it out at home.”  “That’s a terrible plan for any healthcare problem, especially one that can kill you,” Bartlett says.  Waiting For A Useless Vaccine  Dr. Fauci, the NIH, the CDC and governments around the world are pinning their hopes on a vaccine. That is a strategy doomed to failure because, just like influenza, viruses mutate all the time, and every year, the flu vaccine is changed. This is the reason entities like the Gates Foundation and Big Pharma love vaccines so much. They can make massive amounts of money, because it never ends – it is recurring income.  COVID-19 is just like the ‘flu that kills more than a million people every year. It is an inflammatory respiratory disease and there are already proven safe protocols to keep that kind of medical problem under control.  The fact that the course of action proposed by Dr. Bartlett costs $200 and some of the untested antivirals cost $30,000 plus a hospital stay says a lot about why some people push for a vaccine. People have been conditioned to believe an annual vaccine is the answer to every problem.  Dr. Bartlett’s Paper  In an effort to attract attention to this breakthrough information, Dr. Bartlett has written a paper that cites 51 other articles. The problem is that papers take months to be peer-reviewed and published. In the meantime, people continue to die. Doctors could use this safe protocol now, without waiting, if they knew about it. That’s the reason for this story – one more possibility of getting the information into the hands of people who can make a difference.  Dr. Bartlett isn’t sitting idle, either. He is doing his best to get this information out, but governments work very slowly. They always have and likely always will. While governments around the world dither, people die. Politicians are often protected from information like this, thanks to their staff, who decide what they see. We’re trying to get past those gatekeepers, and would appreciate your help.  This protocol may not work in every case, but the halting of new deaths in Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore shows that it is thousands of times better than what is happening in the U.S. and most other countries today. The key is early action.  To hear the complete interview with Dr. Richard Bartlett by Debbie Georgatos on “America Can We Talk,” watch the video below.

9ee6f89f,Benefit cap will leave tens of thousands more children in poverty in 'monstrous new assault' on families,"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inbox Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later. Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Tens of thousands of families face being made homeless and thrown into poverty because of the new benefits cap, campaigners warn.  From tomorrow the total amount of benefits a household can receive will be cut from £26,000 to £23,000 in London and to £20,000 in the rest of the country.  Charities have warned the new measures will leave 112,000 families responsible for 320,000 children up to £115 a week worse off.  The reduction in the cap will also hit an estimated 42,000 single parents.  The Children’s Society says the harsher rules could lead to more families being made homeless and forced to move away from their children’s friends and schools.  “There are already 3.9million children living in poverty across Britain and the new cap is likely to cause that total to rise. Children’s health, well-being and mental health could all be put at risk,” the Society says.  More than one in ten families affected by the cap are unable to work because of caring responsibilities or disability or long-term sickness.  Matthew Reed, Chief Executive of The Children’s Society, said: “Given the Prime Minister’s aspiration of making Britain a country that works for everyone, it is deeply disappointing that the Government is pushing ahead with an ongoing agenda of cuts to financial support for children in low-income families.  Making savings by cutting help for the poorest children is unnecessary and unfair.  Image: Getty Images  “This is a blunt instrument trying to solve a complex problem.  The policy is targeted at workless adults, but the reality is that children are considerably more likely than adults to lose out and there is nothing fair about trying to balance the books on the backs of poor children.  “We fully support efforts to make work pay, but it is not right to achieve this by putting more children on the breadline.  Even at this late stage we would urge ministers to exclude children’s benefits from the cap so that children and their already struggling families do not suffer even more hardship.  “At the same time the Government should provide better incentives for families to move into work by reversing recent cuts to support for working families in Universal Credit.”  Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Debbie Abrahams MP said: “Despite Theresa May’s warm words on the steps of No 10, when she said she wanted to help families who are ‘just managing’, she is allowing the reduction of the so-called ‘benefit cap’ to go ahead. From 7th November, more than 116,000 households will be affected including 320,000 children.  “Charities are warning of an escalation of homelessness which currently includes over 100,000 children living in temporary accommodation. Widows and widowers, veterans and disabled people up and down the country will lose up to £100 per week.”  Rehana Azam, the national secretary of the GMB union, added: “Just four months ago, Theresa May stood on the steps of Downing Street promising to fight injustice and to ensure every person regardless of their background would be given the chance to be all they want to be.  Today she is unleashing a monstrous new assault on 40,000 single mothers, which risks shattering the life chances of children up and down our country.”  Image: REUTERS  “This has echoes of the staggering hypocrisy and chilling callousness that saw the victimisation of single mothers in the bad old days of the early 1990s. Theresa May once said she would change the ‘nasty party’ but the mask has slipped again.”  A Department for Work and Pensions pointed to statistics showing that more than 23,000 households who previously had their benefits capped had since found work.  Work and Pensions Secretary Damian Green said: “Each statistic represents a person who has moved into employment and can now enjoy the security and dignity that works brings.  “By making sure that those people who are out of work are faced with the same choices as those who are in work, the benefit cap has been a real success.  “By lowering the cap today, we are ensuring the values of this Government continue to chime with those of ordinary working people and delivering on our commitment to make sure work pays more than welfare”.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies IFS economic think tank said the new benefit cap would “almost exclusively affects families with large numbers of children or very high rents or both.”  The IFS also said more than half of those affected would have “at least four children.”  “For those families who are affected, the impact can be large. Households who are already capped will lose a further £3,000 per year in London or £6,000 per year elsewhere,” the IFS said.  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said: “Theresa May said one thing on Downing Street and is now robbing some of the poorest families of £6,000. She just mislead the British public and is now clobbering those who can afford it least. It’s makes her party look like hypocrites.  “How can the Conservatives do this and call themselves the workers party? It’s disgraceful.”",false
1aab4af3,These 12 Graphs Show Mask Mandates Do Nothing To Stop COVID,"No matter how strictly mask laws are enforced nor the level of mask compliance the population follows, cases all fall and rise around the same time.  Masks have become a political tool and a talisman. When COVID-19 hit, governments panicked and created enormous fear. The Centers for Disease Control currently estimates a COVID-19 survival rate of 99.99 percent for people younger than 50, but the damage created by the panic was too great to undo.  It is likely that some politicians eventually realized their mistake and needed a way to back-pedal without admitting their lockdowns were a policy disaster. Their solution was for people to put any old piece of cloth across their face and magically believe that it’s okay to go out shopping again.  Masks are not merely a small inconvenience. They have inadvertently become a key impediment to returning to a more normal life, a desirable goal for those seeking to twist the pandemic for political and electoral purposes.  Masks dehumanize us, and ironically serve as a constant reminder that we should be afraid. People can now be spotted wearing masks while camping by themselves in the woods or on a solo sailing trip. They have become a cruel device on young children everywhere, kindergarten students covered by masks and isolated by Plexiglas, struggling to understand the social expressions of their peers. Face coverings are causing real harm to the American psyche, provide little to no medical benefit, and distract us from more important health policy issues.  The mask dogma had many cracks in it from the start. For one, the U.S. surgeon general and the Centers for Disease Control both previously said that “masks are NOT effective in preventing [the] general public from catching coronavirus,” so they were already starting with a credibility deficit. Furthermore, many officials have been frequently caught without masks when they think the cameras are off them. Dr. Anthony Fauci, for example, has been caught doing this multiple times.  Chicago’s mayor and local media were all caught taking off their masks and violating social distancing as soon as a press conference ended. This was caught in a now deleted YouTube video that was shared by a now deleted Twitter account after being retweeted more than 26,000 times. As of the date of this publication, it is still available to view in a crude video of a video that has yet to be deleted on YouTube.  Clearly, some people do not want you to see what politicians do behind the scenes. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a strong advocate for mandatory masking, was caught off camera laughing about how wearing masks is an act of “political theater.”  Faking ‘Science’ to Achieve Political Goals  These same politicians and health officials are so desperate to make people believe in masks that they doctor charts to make their case, even when their own data actually undermines them. So what is the actual science behind masks? Let’s begin by reviewing the leading scientific studies.  The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University summarized six international studies which “showed that masks alone have no significant effect in interrupting the spread of ILI or influenza in the general population, nor in healthcare workers.” Oxford went on to say that “that despite two decades of pandemic preparedness, there is considerable uncertainty as to the value of wearing masks.” They prophetically warned that this has “left the field wide open for the play of opinions, radical views and political influence.”  A study of health-care workers in more than 1,600 hospitals showed that cloth masks only filtered out 3 percent of particles. An article in the New England Journal of Medicine stated, “[W]earing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection” and that “[T]he desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.”  There are many other credible studies showing lack of mask efficacy, such as studies published in the National Center for Biotechnology Information, Cambridge University Press, Oxford Clinical Infectious Diseases, and Influenza Journal, just to name a few.  Studies do show masks can help in the case of direct respiratory droplets, which would matter if somebody is coughing, breathing, or sneezing directly on your face. That happens normally in a tight and highly confined space.  But the plentiful evidence we have indicates masks would not meaningfully help with aerosol transmission, where two people are just in the same area, or even the same room. This is because the two people end up breathing the same air, with or without a mask, as visually demonstrated in this video.  Now for Graphs about International Mask Mandates  Historical scientific studies do not make a compelling case that universal masking would meaningfully help, so let’s explore real-world situations to see where data leads us.  Austria was one of the first governments to require masks, and it did so about 10 days after its cases began to go down. The level of downtrend did not change or improve after masks were required. After the nation’s people wearing masks for an extended period, cases are currently four times where they were when Austria mandated masks, and cases continue to climb.  Germany mandated masks about halfway down its original recovery. Their cases are now similarly climbing quickly.  The French now have around 1,000 percent more daily cases they had when they mandated masks, despite having one of the highest mask compliance levels in the world.  Spain was not far behind its French neighbor with a mandate. Spain required masks when cases were near zero and has the highest compliance with mask-wearing in all Europe. Now Spain is at around 1,500 percent the level of cases compared to when it mandated masks.  After three months of requiring masks, the United Kingdom is at around 1,500 percent more cases despite having one of the highest mask compliance records in Europe.  Belgium required masks shortly after the British did, and now possibly has the highest rate of cases in the world.  Italy had extremely high levels of mask-wearing despite no national mandate. Recently skyrocketing cases finally compelled them to create one of the strictest mask laws in the world, but the results have predictably failed to slow the rise in coronavirus cases. In fact, cases skyrocketed immediately after the mask mandate went into effect.  Similar results have been found in Ireland, Portugal, Israel, and many other countries. No matter how strictly mask laws are enforced nor the level of mask compliance the population follows, cases all fall and rise around the same time.  How about the United States? Americans have proven to be highly compliant with mask wearing, even higher than the Germans.  It is therefore no surprise that the same trends found in Europe are also found in U.S. states. For example, California required masks in June but cases still went up by more than 300 percent and the state remains heavily locked down four months later with still higher cases.  Hawaii suffered one of the most economically devastating lockdowns of all the U.S. states. It was also an early mover on mandating masks both indoors and outdoors, but cases still went up by almost 1,000 percent.  With and without mask mandates, Texas and Georgia followed nearly identical case development.  For those more interested in comparing deaths than cases, we again don’t see a pattern of masks meaningfully helping.  Why Don’t Masks Work?  Why don’t masks work on the general public? For one, if you read the fine print on most consumer masks you will see something along the line of “not intended for medical purposes and has not been tested to reduce the transmission of disease.” Masks can work well when they’re fully sealed, properly fitted, changed often, and have a filter designed for virus-sized particles. This represents none of the common masks available on the consumer market, making universal masking much more of a confidence trick than a medical solution.  If we actually wanted effective masks, then manufacturers should be conducting scientific tests evaluating masks specifically for their ability to reduce the spread of coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration and CDC should be making recommendations on which masks to use and approving masks based on their scientific efficacy rather than promoting the wrapping of any piece of miscellaneous cloth around your face.  Many powerful institutions have too much political capital invested in the mask narrative at this point, so the dogma is perpetuated.  Effective masks, if they exist, should then be distributed to highly vulnerable groups for use only in rare and extenuating circumstances. There would be little point for the population at large to wear masks all the time because while focused protection may be possible, it is not possible to eradicate the virus at this point or stop its spread.  Our universal use of unscientific face coverings is therefore closer to medieval superstition than it is to science, but many powerful institutions have too much political capital invested in the mask narrative at this point, so the dogma is perpetuated. The narrative says that if cases go down it’s because masks succeeded. It says that if cases go up it’s because masks succeeded in preventing more cases. The narrative simply assumes rather than proves that masks work, despite overwhelming scientific evidence to the contrary.  The narrative further ignores places like Sweden and Georgia, which never required masks in the first place, and it suppresses new scientific evidence if it doesn’t support desired political results, such as data from the world’s only randomized trial investigating if masks actually protect from COVID-19. Even a Nobel laureate has been canceled because his COVID charts and data were found to be undesirable.  History does not bode well for times that politics meddles with science. Martin Kulldorff, a professor at Harvard Medical School and a leader in disease surveillance methods and infectious disease outbreaks, describes the current COVID scientific environment this way: “After 300 years, the Age of Enlightenment has ended.”  In the end, it will be the loss of credibility in our scientific institutions, and the unnecessary division they have sowed among us, for which masks will be remembered.",false
c9c6869b,Cicilline Marks Equal Pay Day By Stressing Importance of Closing Wage Gap Between Women and Men,"Washington – U.S. Congressman David Cicilline D-RI, who has co-sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act in the House, today called on House Republicans to help close the wage gap that still exists between women and men in the workforce.  “Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace. It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market,” said Cicilline.  In January 2009, the Democratic-led 111th Congress sent to the President’s desk the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act – and it became the first bill signed into law by President Obama. This Act, a great victory for women, restores the right of women to challenge unfair pay in court – but virtually all House Republicans rejected this critical measure for women. Cicilline, who was sworn into office in January 2011, has continued to press for additional measures to protect equal pay for women.  “While the Lilly Ledbetter Act marked a significant achievement there is still more work to be done. I am a proud cosponsor of the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would enhance the remedies available under the Equal Pay Act to better to better equip women fighting against wage discrimination. Although the House Republican leadership has failed to consider this measure, I will continue to stand up with the other members of our state’s delegation to promote progress for Rhode Island women and their families,” added Cicilline.  This year, Equal Pay Day also falls on Tax Day. Just as Cicilline is fighting to achieve equal pay for women in the workforce, he is also fighting for basic fairness in the tax code. While women are struggling in the workplace with unfair pay, it adds insult to injury that many workers with modest incomes are actually paying a higher tax rate than their well-paid bosses. That is why Congressman Cicilline, who authored a letter to Speaker Boehner last week urging the House to enact a “Buffett Rule,” today reiterated the importance of ensuring that multimillion dollar earners no longer pay a smaller share of their income in taxes than middle class Rhode Island families.",partially false

That’s exactly what occurred for Dementia Joe’s big “Birthday Bash.”  It was a rollicking event, complete with singers, no masks, and absolutely no social distancing whatsoever.

fbbca6e5,"The Unvaccinated Amish Rarely Get Cancer, Autism or Heart Disease","The Amish are a group of traditional Christian people with Swiss origins. They rarely receive vaccines, and they rarely come down with diseases like cancer, autism or heart disease. Coincidence? Let’s dig deeper and find out.  All parents want best for their children, and I think we can all agree that we should be raising the absolute healthiest and brightest children we possibly can. Afterall, children are our future, so we owe it to them and to humanity to take an honest, logical look at this issue.  Getting Real About Vaccines  For me there are a number of things I see happening with the vaccine industry that make me skeptical of their products, intentions and competency when it comes to human health.  Here are a few red flags for me when it comes to vaccines:  Flu shots contain multiple neurotoxins at very high concentrations.  Influenza Virus Vaccine contains 25,000x higher levels of mercury than what the EPA says is safe in drinking water.  Flu shots are not backed by any safety trials or efficacy data.  Patients are not given the potential risks associated with vaccines  Pharmaceutical companies pushing vaccines have absolute legal immunity against anybody claming their products caused damage. Yikes!  By this logic, adding snake venom to vaccines would make them even healthier. Sorry but I don’t buy it!  The fact that we’re injecting neurotoxic and carcinogenic chemicals into the youngest and most vulnerable among us – our children – dozens of times before they reach the age of 6 is particularly concerning. Medical frauds are not uncommon – is it far fetched at all to suggest we’re witnessing another one take place?  If the government and vaccine industries truly cared about our health, wouldn’t vaccines contain things like vitamins, ocean mineral blends, flavonoids and other plant extracts that have been proven to boost immunity rather than infected animal tissue and harsh poisons like mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum?  The Rising Epidemic of Autism  Sharp increases in the number of vaccines given to children over the past two decades have occurred in direct proportion to increased cases of autism spectrum disorder ASD. Every jab contributes to increased accumulation of poisons in the brain of children, causing widespread brain and bodily damage that is often labelled and officially diagnosed as autism.  Vaccines Synergize with Glyphosate Sprays on Food  Another thing to be aware of is the synergistic negative effects these chemicals have when combined with genetically modified foods containing the active ingredient roundup.  Studies have shown that glyphosate inhibits every single one of the 50 cytochrome P450 enzymes responsible for detoxification in the human body.  For people eating the standard American diet, it’s almost impossible to avoid eating these poisons sprayed on GMO food. When a person receives vaccines, then consumes glyphosate-containing herbicide sprays, the excretion of the chemicals from both the vaccines and from food will be inhibited, maximizing and extending the duration of their harmful effects.  The Amish Opt Out of Vaccines and Rarely Develop Autism  When you compare Autism rates among the Amish community to the US national average, you can expect to find about 200 children with Autism. Yet if you take a trip to the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch country, you wouldn’t even find yourself 6 Amish children with autism.  Why not? Because to date, there are only 3 diagnosed cases of autism among the Amish, and one of those cases is in a child who was adopted from China. Another Amish child diagnosed with autism was diagnosed after being vaccinated.  Let’s take a look at some of the worldwide and US national statistics regarding Autism to learn more about this recent phenomenon:  Autism affects over 20 million people worldwide  Autism occurs in boys four to five times more often than in girls  One of every 68 children has some form of ASD in the US  US Autism rates have increased 38% since 2012.  Researchers like Dr. Stephanie Senoff of MIT have predicted rates of autism will be 1 in 2 in the US by 2025.  This spike in the number of cases of autism over the past two decades in the US coincide directly with the vaccine schedule increase, by quantity and frequency, that is being enforced by the CDC.  Today, US children receive an alarming 50 innoculations before age 7, many of them containing various combinations of diseases, mercury, formaldehyde, known neurotoxins like monosodium glutamate and aluminum.  Flu shots contain the highest levels of mercury of all jabs – up to 25,000 times greater than what the EPA allows in drinking water or in fish sold as food. Are you aware that the CDC’s own statistics have shown that children who receive mercury-containing vaccinations in the form of thimerosal are 27 times more likely to develop autism than those who don’t get jabs?  Formaldehyde is a carcinogen that coroners soak dead people in to ensure their body’s don’t decay. Do you really want to inject this into yourself or your child?  You may be confused why your family doctor would recommend vaccines and claim they are safe and effective despite all of this – unfortunately, doctor’s are human too and they only know what they’ve been taught. Always do your own research, think for yourself and come to your own conclusions.  For Religious Reasons, the Amish opt out of all vaccines  The Amish are lucky because opting out of all vaccines means they’ve avoided three highly-controversial vaccines involved in the biggest medical cover-up in history – hepatitis B, HPV and the MMR.  Here’s the cole’s notes version for the Hep B vaccine cover-up: The CDC claimed that thimerosal 50% mercury was removed from the multi-dose version of the hepatitis B vaccine, but they lied.  The vulnerable central nervous systems of the young Amish are spared the onslaught of this volatile toxin thanks to their parent’s unwillingness to believe unquestioningly what they’re told by authorities. As a result, Amish children rarely experience learning disabilities, as well as common US diseases like cancer, heart disease and diabetes.  Of course, there are a number of factors, like eating cleaner food that’s not soaked in toxic herbicides containing glyphosate and others and generally they tend to avoid pharmaceutical drugs. Why won’t the government fund a study comparing Amish health with non-Amish health?  Despite the reality we see around us, and the many red flags when it comes to vaccine safety and efficacy, the CDC refuses to regulate the vaccine industry. As a result, the health of our children and our neighbor’s children are put in the hands of the immoral few in the upper class of society.  Conclusion  Our best strategy to find the truth about vaccines is to compare the health of groups of people who have received vaccines with groups of people who have not. The Amish are a shining example of health and they are almost exclusively unvaccinated. Therefore, it’s plain to see that vaccines are not only not helping people, but based on the long list of severe side effects, including brain damage, autism spectrum disorder ASD, paralysis, and death, that the existing vaccines being pushed hard by the government and corporations profiting from them are, overall, doing far more harm than good.  Considering some of the most potent anti-carcinogens, contained within common foods like oranges or coconuts, are readily absorbed and available through dietary means, even if we were to formulate the absolute best nutrient-based vaccines, vaccines probably still wouldn’t be needed.  If you truly want immunity, eating clean foods raised with maximum nutrition in mind is a good starting point. Even better, make it your goal to make your escape from the destructive, toxic city life and begin growing as much of your own food as possible for yourself and your family.

bb6280cb,Bill Withers Leaves $2 Million Estate to Trump Re-election Campaign –…,"He always said there’s no sunshine when you’re gone, but now that’s he gone himself, he left us at least one ray of sunshine. That ray of sunshine is a 2 million dollar estate left to the Trump re-election campaign.  Before he died, Bill Withers said the following of Trump:  “I know, I know, I know, I know, people wouldn’t think I’m a supporter of Donald Trump, but I am. Donald Trump is a great man that has done the most of any president for black people. Black unemployment is way down, crime is lower, everything is better under Trump. I’d be a fool to not support this guy.”  Withers’ last will and testament stated that all of the assets will be sold, and all proceeds will be donated to Trump’s campaign. Any remaining funds will be donated to Ivanka’s 2024 campaign and the Be Best initiative to stop online bullying, the kind Donald Trump participates in himself.  Actor Joe Barron praised Withers:  “He was a great man. Sad to see him go, but at least he’s leaving a legacy behind by supporting the only president that cares about us. It just goes to show that Bill Withers was a real American patriot, the likes of Clint Eastwood. We don’t have many like that anymore.”  At press time, the estate was already being sold at auction, and Trump is preparing to use the funds to construct a new golf course in Florida. This is a great use of the funds as it is an investment in America.  Share this:  .  Like this: Like Loading... Like Be the first to like this.  .",false

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice  Record numbers of people living in poverty in Britain are in working households, a shock study shows.  Despite an increase in employment, in-work poverty has gone up because of low pay and not enough hours of work/  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation JRF’s ‘state of the nation’ report on poverty found 56% of people in poverty are in a working family, compared to 39% 20 years ago.  Poverty has also increased for children and pensioners over the last five years, according to the research group.  The JRF research shows 14m people are living in poverty, including 4m children and 2m pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  Union leaders said the findings showed a pressing need to ban zero-hour contracts and increase the minimum wage and head teachers said the country’s record on poverty was “truly shocking.”  Are you a struggling parent? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk  The highest poverty rates were in London, the North of England, the Midlands and Wales, and lowest were in the South, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the study.  The differences in poverty rates were often driven by the availability of good quality jobs and housing costs.  People were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  JRF is urging the government to improve job security and quality, see the benefits system as an essential public service that loosens the grip of poverty, and help make more low-cost housing available.  Image: Julian Hamilton/Daily Mirror  Claire Ainsley, JRF executive director, said: “The new Government has an historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s.  “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.  “Millions of families care for each other, raise their children and work hard without any guarantee that they will escape poverty, governments, employers and landlords all have a role to play in changing this.  “It’s not right that so many are unable to build a firm foundation to their lives because their jobs are insecure or they can’t find a home they can afford.  “Without a better deal for working families, and a social security system that provides a public service for all of us, the UK faces further division and deeper poverty.  “That better deal needs to encompass the basics we all need, from building new homes to funding social security and bringing better jobs to all parts of the country.”  Image: Getty Images  Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary, said: “The Government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs.  “Zero hours contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  JRF said the poverty indicator it used is when a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, which found in a poll of members last year that 83% had seen an increase in the number of children coming to school hungry in the last five years, said: “School leaders are seeing more and more hardworking families struggling, and more children living in poverty.  “This country’s record on child poverty is truly shocking. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds have disproportionately suffered from cuts not just to education, but to all the wider services that should be there to help them.  “Successive governments have failed to invest in those who need it the most. This government must have the confidence to change that record.  “Schools are at the centre of efforts to improve equality of opportunity. But the issues that underpin inequality reach far beyond the school gates and exist throughout the communities that schools serve. Inequality will remain entrenched in the UK unless the government takes urgent action to break the grip of poverty.”",false
62a86a8c,Vacuums panic buying hits shops as deadline looms for Brussels ban,"Advertisement  Shoppers are panic-buying powerful vacuum cleaners to beat an EU ban that comes into force next week.  Last night retailers reported that sales had soared by nearly 50 per cent as consumers snap up any remaining stock in the run-up to the Brussels diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts.  Many stores and websites have already run out of the most powerful models, with one reporting its busiest day for sales in more than a decade.  Scroll down for video  Stampede: Shoppers are panic-buying powerful vacuum cleaners to beat an EU ban coming into force next week. Above, some of models that will be affected by the ban  The buying frenzy looks set to intensify today and tomorrow, before the official ban on importing or manufacturing the machines takes effect on Monday.  And Brussels is now considering measures to ban the most powerful hairdryers, lawn mowers and electric kettles, it was revealed.  A list of up to 30 high-wattage household devices could be banned next spring following a draft EU report which examined ways to reduce power consumption.  Consumer magazine Which? said the new rules on vacuum cleaners would outlaw some of the best machines, which owe their strong suction ability to their high power consumption.  A previous story on the Brussels ban, as reported in the Mail on August 23, 2014  From September 1, companies will be prohibited from manufacturing or importing any vacuum cleaners above the 1,600-watt limit as part of a drive to reduce domestic electricity use.  Tesco yesterday said it saw sales rocket by 44 per cent over the past two weeks as panicked customers rushed to get their hands on popular 2,000-watt models.  The Cooperative Electrical shop reported a rise of 38 per cent, while at Currys some models of powerful vacuums were sold out.  Online electrical retailer ao.com said sales were up 40 per cent last week compared with the same period last year and last Friday it had its best ever day for vacuum cleaner sales in the 14 years it has been trading.  Tesco planning manager Louise Rix said: ‘The EU ban has been a much debated topic over the last few days – it’s certainly provoked a lot of interest amongst consumers and manufacturers.  ‘We’ve seen huge sales increases of vacuums and we expect the high demand to continue over the next two days before the ban comes into place.’  The ban from Monday on powerful vacuum cleaners has angered manufacturers, who say it will do nothing to make machines more environmentally friendly and will simply reduce efficiency in the home.  Critics say cleaners satisfying the new rule may use less power but householders will have to use them for longer – so they are likely to use the same amount of electricity in the long run.  For the first time, vacuum cleaners will have to carry ratings from A to G for energy use, cleaning performance on carpets and hard floors, and dust emissions.  Measures: The buying frenzy looks set to intensify today and tomorrow, before the official ban on importing or manufacturing powerful vacuum cleaners left takes effect on Monday. And Brussels is now considering measures to ban the most powerful hairdryers, lawn mowers right, file picture and electric kettles, it was revealed  Yesterday, there was evidence that consumers are stockpiling their favourite models to use in the decades to come.  Chris Wesson, posted a photograph on Twitter of two 2,000-watt Panasonic vacuums which he said his mother had bought.  He tweeted the comment: ‘Only my mum would stock up on powerful vacuum cleaners before this ban comes into effect. We now have five in our house...’  But Leanne Beswick, of ao.com, said there was no need to panic buy – and that lower wattage does not necessarily equate to a poorer performing machine.  ‘We have seen a significant surge in sales of corded vacuums over 1600 watts over the weekend as the deadline for meeting new EU legislation looms on September 1,’ she said. ‘However, consumers need not panic buy.  Consumers are snapping up any remaining stock in the run-up to the diktat outlawing machines of over 1,600 watts. Above, the European Commission's headquarters  ‘Even though these particular models will eventually be off the market, this doesn’t mean that new and other existing models are any less effective – they are not. Although they may need to lose power to conform to the new regulations, they won’t lose performance.’  A Currys & PC World spokesperson said: 'We still have a good stocks of high powered vacuum cleaners at great prices. We will however be adding new products to our range with the best technology that adhere to the new energy and performance ruling.  'These new ranges are built with state of the art engineering with the same high standards to ensure customers reap the benefits without compromising quality.'  While the ban comes into place on Monday, retailers will still be able to sell their remaining stock after this date.  We expect the high demand to continue over the next two days before the ban comes into place Louise Rix, Tesco  Last week consumer watchdog Which? warned that many of the best models that appear in its Best Buy tables will be taken off the market as a result of the new EU rule.  Of seven awarded ‘Best Buy’ status since January 2013, five have motors with a power of more than 1,600 watts, it said.  The maximum wattage will be lowered further to 900 watts by 2017. Current cleaners have an average wattage of 1,800.  Which? said: ‘If you’re in the market for a powerful vacuum, you should act quickly, before all of the models currently available sell out. A best buy 2,200-watt vac costs around £27 a year to run in electricity – only £8 more than the best-scoring 1,600-watt we’ve tested.’  Marlene Holzner, the European Commission’s energy spokesman, said the amount of wattage does not automatically indicate how well a vacuum will perform.",partially false

A spokesperson for the organization, Sandy Batt, issued this statement to the press:  “Nascar is in direct violation of our First Amendment right to freedom of speech. You would think such a large organization that employs hundreds of lawyers would understand the Constitution, especially the First Amendment and how it applies to companies. We have the right to fly our flags. They are beautiful flags and we want to fly them. It’s not even racist. It’s just a battle flag. It reminds me of what Germany did to the swastika. That is a beautiful Native American symbol that is now banned over there. That’s the real racism right there, erasing native American history. It seems liberals have a double standard no matter the country. That tyranny is coming here folks. We won’t give up our Constitutional rights without a fight!”  This is great news for all that love freedom. Americans everywhere are standing up for their rights. The liberals will lose in court as always, and America will prevail. We have no other choice.",false
4c911969,This New Bill Would Allow Texas Teachers To Kill Their Students If They Felt It Was Needed,"Texas state Rep. Dan FlynnR has proposed a bill called the Teacher’s Protection Act H.B.868. It would allow teachers to use deadly force on school property, a school bus, or at an event sponsored by a school either in self-defense or defense of students at the school. Teachers would also be allowed to use guns while defending school property. In addition, teachers who shot someone under such circumstances would be granted “civil immunity,” which means they could not be held liable if the student they shot was injured or killed. Teachers in Texas already have the right to keep guns in the classroom.  Flynn is a strong supporter of gun rights. He has worked on pieces of legislation that permitted people to have guns on college campuses and that reduced the required minimum number of hours of training for a concealed handgun license.  Gun advocates have been demanding that teachers be armed ever since the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012 that resulted in 20 fatalities. Gun control advocates, however, state that easy access to guns increases crime. Psychologists also note that easy access to guns increases the chance of somebody getting shot during an emotionally charged confrontation.  Civil rights organizations also oppose the bill. They point out that black and Latino students are already more likely to be disciplined harshly at school than are their white classmates. They are more likely to be suspended or expelled. Civil rights activists worry that since students of color are already being targeted for their behavior by school authorities, they would be more likely to be the victims of gun-wielding teachers than their white peers.

6c71d2dd,NBA to Trump: Resign or We’ll Never Play Again@usa news,"The National Basketball Association recently suspended its season. At the time, the reason given seemed justified, given the emergence of COVID-19 and that several players in the league have now tested positive. However, it has been confirmed by anonymous sources that a league shutdown has been in the making for months and that they were simply looking for a good excuse to shut it all down.  The players, led by Washington Generals All-Star Power Forward Art Tubolls, held a secret vote prior to the beginning of the season to suspend the league for any credible reason until President Donald Trump resigns from office or is voted out. Since much of the league is made up of Hollywood actor and musician wannabes, these millionaire crybabies overwhelming voted to approve the measure.  Tubolls said  “Our league is the most popular league in the world and we have a lot of teams in the swing states. We know that we cannot directly pressure the President into resigning but if we can hold his approval rating hostage and make the people scream for his removal, that’s what we’ll do. Worst case is that we get him out in November. We have a plan for the rest of this season if we get our way and we have a schedule set to begin on January 21, 2021 if it comes down to it.”  The liberal elite has been relentlessly attacking our country and our President.  First, LeBron James threatened the sit out unless our National Anthem is no longer being played before games and now this. Even the NHL and Major League Baseball have joined this futile effort. We all need to stand firm and show these overgrown millionaire toddlers that they need us more than we need them this November.",false
8e1c39c2,FEMA “Smart” Guillotines Placed in FEMA Internment Camps video,"FEMA “Smart” Guillotines Placed in FEMA Internment Camps video  % of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.  If all information is accurate, the Deep State, using FEMA as its agent of evil, is expediting plans to herd humans into internment camps. The acquisition of smart guillotines is a portent of the Deep State’s hatred of America, the American people, and of the document—the Constitution—our forefathers authored to protect us from the wicked machinations of the very government we elected into office.  “All states have them, but Texas got the majority right now,” our source said.  The 500 units were sent to FEMA camps near Austin, a New World Orderin Waco, and a FEMA internment camp disguised as a water treatment facility in Carrolton.  “FEMA’s main focus is on Texas. All eyes on Texas. If there’s going to be a public insurrection, they know the battle lines will be dawn in Texas. They know the patriot community is thick in Texas. That’s why Texas is receiving more of these smart guillotines than any other state. FEMA’s first strike will occur in Texas,” our source said.  The Andrews AFB shipment—over 500 smart guillotines–was distributed by rail to FEMA zone six, an area encompassing Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Belgrade, and Arkansas, primarily “red” states likely to resist a declaration of Martial Law or a military incursion against the American people.  After Obama left office, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security kept the smart guillotine project alive, using slush funds and black project money to fund three thousand of the villainous devices, each of which reportedly cost seventeen million dollars. FEMA ordered them from the Chinese, our source added, because the agency “felt guilty” about using Made-in-America products to execute Americans. In addition, the Chinese versions are less costly.  “The Deep State, and by association FEMA, recognized that some of its own people’s heads might accidentally wind up on the chopping block. They had to devise a way to stop the blade from lopping off friendly heads. So, when a person is face down waiting for the blade to fall, the computer scans the face and iris. If it matches a friendly face stored in a database, the blade won’t fall, and the person is set free,” our source said.  If a person resists, arm and leg restraints spring forth from recessed compartments, rendering the victim immobile. Moreover, the smart guillotines employ biometric scanning, including facial recognition technology to exonerate persons mistakenly placed on the guillotine for execution.  For example, the headrest has motion sensors and pressure plates that detect the presence of a human neck. No operator is needed; a computer drops and retracts a razor-sharp weighted titanium blade, which, our source said, can sever several hundred heads per sharpening.  The condemned person is secured with stocks at the bottom of the frame, positioning the neck directly below the blade. The blade is then released, to quickly fall and forcefully decapitate the victim with a single, clean pass so that the head falls into a basket below. The smart guillotine retains the basic design while adding several scientific advancements.  The guillotine gained popularity during the French Revolution. The device consists of a tall, upright frame in which a weighted and angled blade is raised to the top and suspended.  He said the smart guillotine project was commissioned in 2011, at the request of former president Barrack Hussein Obama, who had hoped during his term toand use the deadly apparatus against patriots and freedom fighters that challenged his one-world government agenda. The guillotine, he added, is the ideal method of execution for instilling fear among the masses.  The technologically advanced guillotines, he said, are being manufactured in Beijing before being flown exclusively to US airbases. Then, the military distributes the guillotines to FEMA camps nationwide.  A United States Air force C-17 cargo plane arrived at Andrews Air Force Base loaded with crates of “smart” guillotines, says a White House insider speaking under condition of anonymity.

In 2018 alone, major corporations have authorized more than $250 billion in corporate stock buyback schemes . These stock buybacks overwhelmingly benefit wealthy shareholders and corporate executives – not workers. In fact, 84% of stocks are owned by the top ten percent of Americans.  At the end of the day, Republicans will try to force the American people to pay for their massive tax giveaway to the wealthy through major cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. The facts are clear – the Republican tax bill that was sold as a “middle-class miracle” was really a GOP Tax Scam.  *Based on closing price on the day share buyback was announced.

c70fd1b6,"Federal Study Finds Marijuana 100X Less Toxic Than Alcohol, Safer Than Tobacco","Science once again catching up with what many already knew – but this is progress: A new scientific study has investigated the toxicity of various drugs and found Marijuana the clear winner. It’s been found significantly less toxic than all the other substances on the list – including not only illegal drugs but the LEGAL alcohol and tobacco. Here’s our full report.  Claims on marijuana’s medicinal values have been widely debated despite support from medical research and study. Federal legislations that govern marijuana use aim to restrict rather than regulate – and this has posed a problem to people seeking the medicinal and recreational effects of the herb, very far from intentions of abusing its effects. What is it about marijuana that scares the government – and the public – so much?  Marijuana Use in the United States  Marijuana, colloquially referred to as weed or pot, is made up of dried leaves and flowers of the hemp plant Cannabis sativa. Statistics released by the National Institute of Drug Abuse reveal that in respondents aged 18 to 25, more than half exactly 51.90 percent have used marijuana. Percentages are lower in the other two age groups, with 16.40 percent of respondents aged 12 to 17 and 45.70 percent of respondents aged 26 and older reporting marijuana use. [1]  Laws in more than half the number of states in the US prohibit marijuana use, whether recreationally or medically. Currently 2015, only 21 states plus the District of Columbia have passed medical marijuana laws MMLs that recognize and permit the medicinal use of the herb. [2]  Numerous studies have reported the positive medicinal effects of marijuana on pain, sleep, and overall comfort. A survey conducted by Trip, et. al. 2014 revealed that marijuana use was effective in improving mood, pain, muscle spasms, and sleep quality in patient with prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. [3] The data collected from a more recent study in 2015 by Degenhardt, et. al. revealed that marijuana use in conjunction with prescribed opioids were able to induce effective pain relief in respondents experiencing chronic non-cancer pain. [4] These studies further support the popularity of marijuana use among people experiencing acute and chronic pain.  On the other hand, there have also been studies on the adverse effects of marijuana. One of these was published in mid-2014, focusing the negative health effects of smoking marijuana, particularly on the increased risk for lung cancer. [5] Of course, the study was only able to reveal how it was smoke not cannabis itself that damages lung tissue. This problem could easily be solved by changing the method in which marijuana is administered.  Risk Assessment of Marijuana and Other Substances  But is marijuana use as dangerous as the law makes it out to be? The intoxicating effects of marijuana, although different, are not thought more severe than that of mild to moderate alcohol intake – a substance that is not illegal anywhere in the United States, or most countries all over the world. A study published in January 2015 by Lechenmeier and Rehm [6] assessed the comparative risk between different “mind-altering” substances, specifically alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other illicit drugs like heroin. Surprisingly, the study revealed that cannabis was the least risky substance, belonging to the other end of the spectrum. Do you know what substance was revealed the most risky? Alcohol.  How is this possible? The study used an approach called the Margin of Exposure MOE which is drastically different from other studies that simply attempted to find causational relationship between two factors – 1 substance use/abuse and 2 mortality. MOE is different; it’s a ratio between the estimated average human intake and the benchmark dose or toxicological threshold. Basically, it’s a ratio between how much humans typically intake and the dose at which the substance becomes dangerous – which is a better judge of how risky a substance can be. The higher the MOE is, the higher its spot on the list.  The results of the study were conclusive: The highest spot belonged to alcohol, while the succeeding spots were filled by heroin, cocaine, nicotine, MDMA, methamphetamine, methadone, amphetamine, diazepam, and THC or marijuana. With marijuana in the lowest spot over 100 times less toxic than alcohol, it can be surmised that its effects on health and society have been largely overestimated. If there was a plant that couldn’t be more misunderstood – or was it perhaps intentionally maligned – it has to be marijuana.  It’s important to note that the study measured toxic effects and does not consider any social effects of the use of the drug. However, this result is a clear indication that policies on marijuana are outdated and need re-evaluation – which is something that is gradually happening. It’s good news for the herband for the use of herbs in general.  References:  [1] National Institute of Drug Abuse 2014. Marijuana.

Kennedy, Jr.—“Many of the things I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they weren’t true. And, if they are not true, then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that. And they won’t do that because in the United States, truth is an absolute defense against slander.”  This must-watch video details the many problems with the development and safety of Merck’s third-highest grossing product, Gardasil. Children’s Health Defense CHD and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CHD’s Chairman and Chief Legal Counsel, ask that you watch and share this video so that you, and others, may make an informed decision of whether or not to give your child, boy or girl, a Gardasil vaccine. It can also be a useful tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine, that is actually causing health problems with young people, could have been approved by FDA and then recommended by CDC. The video is full of jaw-dropping facts about Gardasil and the clinical trials leading up to its release upon an unsuspecting public.  Transcript of “The Science” presentation:  Download “The Science” Transcript  Children’s Health Defense and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—Science Day Presentation for Gardasil  Hi, I’m Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and I’m making this video for the sake of parents who are trying to make an informed decision of whether or not to give their child, their boy or girl the Gardasil vaccine.  I’m also making this video as a tool for pediatricians who are trying to understand how this vaccine—if it’s actually causing all of these problems with young girls—could have been approved by FDA and then mandated by CDC.  Virtually all of the things that I’m going to talk about in this video are available to the public on public documents as I’m going to show.  Finally, I want to say this about Merck which is the company that makes the Gardasil vaccine.  Many of the things that I’m going to say today would be slanderous if they were not true. And if they’re not true then Merck should sue me. But Merck won’t do that and they won’t do it because in the United States truth is an absolute defense to slander. And second of all Merck knows that if they sue me, I’m going to immediately file a discovery request, and many, many, more documents are going to emerge that illustrate even more fraud by this company on the American public and the people all over the world.  Finally, as a footnote I’m not going to talk today about the specific biological mechanisms that allow this vaccine to cause harm in human beings. That information is out there it’s in dozens of peer-reviewed, published scientific documents. Many of these are described on our website and I urge people to go to the Children’s Health Defense website to educate themselves on those issues.  Today we’re going to talk about the clinical trial about Merck’s fraud in that process…and this is Merck’s claim:  The HPV vaccine will “eliminate cervical cancers and other HPV associated cancers.”  The danger of dying from HPV cancer in this country is 1 death in 43.5 thousand people.  Imagine you have a deck of cards but instead of 50 cards. There’s 43,500 on a on a big, big table and one of those cards is a black card. If you get that, you die.  So, Merck’s deal is that it’s going to remove that black card from the deck. But in order to play the game and make sure that Merck removes the black card, everybody who participates has to put in $420 because that’s the cost of the three-dose Gardasil vaccine.  So, here’s Gardasil by the numbers. So, the cost of the three-jab series average is about $420. There are 76 million children who essentially have been mandated by CDC to receive these vaccines. A blockbuster product from Merck, and global revenues from this vaccine today are about $2.3 billion dollars. It’s the third largest product in the company’s inventory.  The cost of saving one American life is 18.3 million dollars. People could argue whether or not that’s a reasonable value of a human life. What I would say was is that the criteria that we should use for evaluating reasonableness—is there a cheaper way to save more lives? And people would argue that Pap smears are the most effective way that 80 percent of cervical cancer deaths have already been eliminated by Pap smears. And this is the most effective technology.  Incidentally in another context HHS has already put a value on human life and the value is $250k. That is the maximum number that the vaccine compensation program will pay for killing an American citizen.  Prior to marketing the vaccine, the FDA licenses the vaccine, and in that licensing process Merck had to show that the vaccine was safe. According to Federal regulations the word “safety” means “relative freedom from harmful effects, taking into consideration the character of the product in relationship to the condition of the recipient at that time.”  So, what is the condition of the recipients of that target group for this vaccine. And this vaccine targets millions of preteens and teens, for whom the risk of dying from cervical cancer is practically zero. Cervical cancer’s median age of death is 58. It is first diagnosed at age 50 median.  A teenage girl or boy has zero chance of dying of this illness. Which means the threshold for giving this medication is very, very high.  Secondly it is mandated in some jurisdictions So the government is actually—government officials are actually—coming in and ordering people to take this medical intervention. So, we have to be sure that the threshold for risk, “the risk profile” for that medical intervention should be very, very low.  Third, unlike other medical interventions Gardasil recipients are perfectly healthy. So, when you give medication to a healthy individual you have to make sure that the risk profile is practically zero. And in order to determine risk, there is a standardized protocol. And it’s called double-blind placebo studies. What does that mean?  It means that the drug company that’s trying to license this product gives the medication to one group of people, maybe 5,000 or 10,000 people, and gives a placebo, an inert placebo, either an identical looking pill that is inert—it’s either saline or sugar—to a similarly situated group of 5,000 or 10,000 people and it’s double blind meaning that neither the patients nor the researchers knew who got the placebo and who got the actual medication.  And you can see here, here’s what the NIH says about the National Institute for Health placebos: an inactive substance that looks like a drug.  So here are typical examples:  Lipitor was given during its study phase to about 17k subjects. Half of them received Lipitor half of them received a sugar pill that looked identical to Lipitor and they were observed and studied for up to 3.3 years.  Why for so long? Because many of the injuries that are caused by medication are latent—they don’t show up for two or three or four or five years cancer for example may not show up for four or five years after the exposure. Autoimmune diseases and allergies and these kind of things take a long time to diagnose. Enbrel for that reason was delayed for 6.6 years and against a control group that received a saline injection.  Botox, there was a national emergency to get Botox to market so people could get their wrinkles cured, was studied for 51 weeks and it was studied against a saline injection.  Now I’m going to show you one of the really outrageous frauds that Merck committed during the clinical trials. This is an insert that is part of every vaccine package. And you can go on the Internet right now and look up that Merck product and search and find these two tables.  In the initial table you can see a there are three columns and this is a table that just looks at injuries at the vaccine site for redness and itching and bruising and pain at the vaccine site and they use one…there were 5,000 girls—5,088 girls who got the Gardasil vaccine.  Number two, there were 3,470 girls who got the AAHS control, what is that? That is the adjuvant in the vaccine. That is a toxic neurotoxin, that’s put in the vaccine to make it more long-lasting to provoke an immune response in the subject of the vaccine.  And most people believe that it is that aluminum adjuvant that is causing all of these injuries in the girls who are getting the vaccine. And there were 3,470 people who received just the neurotoxin with no antigens and no other vaccine components.  And you have a third group which is the placebo group. What I want you to look at is at these numbers. That in the Gardasil and AAHS control there is virtually the same number of injuries.  And when you get to the saline placebo, that injury rate is cut in half.  Now let’s go to the table where they talk about real systemic injuries…autoimmune diseases, and instead of showing us real science, which is to show us what happened to the saline group, they hide the saline group as a way of fooling you, your pediatrician and the regulatory agency by compressing it into the aluminum group and they never tell us. They say this is a combination of the aluminum adjuvant and the saline placebo. They don’t tell us how many in each category were compressed there. The real thing that you need to watch here is what happened.  These are all very, very serious injuries. These are injuries that in some cases people would feel were worse than death—and that affect people and debilitate for a lifetime in many cases.  And if you look at the bottom of the Gardasil group an astonishing 2.3 percent of the girls in the clinical study who received the Gardasil vaccine got ill from autoimmune diseases, many within seven months of taking the vaccine.  And look what happened in the aluminum group—the same number exactly. 2.3 percent.  Nobody, no parent would allow their daughter to take a substance that had a one-in-40 chance of giving them a lifetime disability.  World Health Organization says that using a spiked placebo, or a faux-cebo as Merck did with Gardasil, puts you at a methodological disadvantage that “it may be difficult or impossible to assess vaccine safety.”  Dr. Stanley Plotkin, who developed the polio vaccine…who developed the pertussis vaccine, who developed the rotavirus vaccine—the Stanley Plotkin award is the Nobel Prize of vaccinology it’s given to the top vaccinologist every year—and what he says is:  Unless you have a true control group you are in LA LA LAND.  Finally, the American Medical Association says the absence of double-blind placebo testing and short-term studies of chronic disease are “the indicia of marketing masquerading as science.”  And that’s what Merck gave us.  The Cochrane Collaboration—thirty thousand scientists from all over the world who came together to create an independent assessment of medical protocols which they saw as being increasingly controlled by the industry—The Cochrane Collaboration said the use of active comparators probably increased the occurrence of harms and the comparative group thereby masking harms created by the HPV vaccine.  And that indeed was Merck’s point…to hide those harms.  So, if you do the math women are 100 times more likely to suffer serious adverse events from the Gardasil vaccine than they are to be protected from cervical cancer.  So now we have a very different bargain in this card game that we’re playing with Merck.  If 43 thousand cards and the black card—the death card is gone—but now, there are a thousand blue cards which if you pick one of those by mistake you have a good chance of getting an autoimmune disease. Nobody would take that bargain.  So, in order to get the FDA license to market this vaccine Merck did a number of studies, which are called protocols. We don’t know how many they did because they’re not telling us they never disclosed it.  The one we’re most concerned with is protocol 18. The reason protocol 18 is critical is because that was the basis for FDA giving Merck the license to produce and market the vaccine.  Why is that? Because protocol 18 is the only one in which the target audience for this vaccine. 11- and 12-year old girls was actually tested, and had a control group. The other ones looked at big cohorts of women were 16 to 25-year old and 16 to 26-year old women.  Protocol 18 looked at girls and boys from ages 9 to 15. It was a total of 1200 children. and almost 600 controls. That is a very, very, tiny group of people to study in order to determine the safety of a product is going to be marketed to billions of children around the world.  Now I’m going to show you one of the key fraudulent flimflams that Merck used to get this license. FDA said they approved Gardasil based on protocol 18 because protocol 18 was of particular interest because it’s the only protocol in which Merck used a true saline placebo instead of the aluminum adjuvant as a control.  That’s what Merck told FDA and the CDC but Merck was lying. It actually did not use a true saline placebo. It used what Merck called the “carrier solution.” Which is all of the components of the vaccine except for the aluminum and the viral particles the antigen.  Among the compounds that we know were in the carrier solution are Polysorbate 80 which we have no idea what the safety profile is because it’s never been tested for safety independently in vaccines. Sodium borate which is borax which is banned by FDA in food products and all food products in the United States, and is banned altogether in Europe, genetically modified yeast, there’s no safety test ever been done on it in vaccines L-histidine, the same, and possibly DNA fragments.  I say possibly because we know there are DNA fragments in the final vaccine, we don’t know how they got there. And Merck has lied about the DNA fragments from the outset.  And despite these potentially toxic components of compounds that are in the vaccine, the 596 children that were given the carrier solution fared much better in the other than any other cohort in the study. The girls and boys who receive the carrier solution were the only significant cohorts with no serious adverse events for the first 15 days.  And here’s another one of the gravamen of the fraud that Merck committed in its Gardasil trials, but it turns out in the protocol 18 study, it appears Merck cut the amount of aluminum that was given to the vaccine group in half. They tested a completely different formulation. If true, we theorize that they took the aluminum out to reduce the number of injuries and to mask the really bad safety profile of this vaccine.  And since the protocol 18 data are not based on the Gardasil vaccine formulation, the trial itself constitutes rank scientific fraud.  Here’s another bag of tricks that was used by Merck in order to skew the clinical trials results in favor of Gardasil.  Merck and its researchers use what they call exclusion criteria—for example people who had zero allergies, people who had prior genital infections were thrown out of the clinical trials. People who had over four sex partners in their entire lives were excluded from the trials. Anybody who had a history of immunological or nervous system disorders, people with chronic illnesses and seizure disorders, people with other medical conditions, people who had reactions to vaccine ingredients including the aluminum, yeast and the benzonase. or anybody with a history of alcohol and drug abuse.  If you really wanted to know whether the vaccine was helping people—if it was effective—wouldn’t you want those people in your study wouldn’t you want people who had a genetic vulnerability to cancer in your study to see if it actually was capable of preventing cancer.  Then Merck had one catch all exclusion category which was any condition which in the opinion of the investigator might interfere with the evaluation of the study objectives. Well, that gave Merck and its paid investigators complete control to throw people out of the study who they thought might make the study look not successful. All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit the study to people who were like All of these exclusionary categories gave Merck the ability to limit this study to people who were like an elite club of superheroes…the people who get the vaccine are not the same people they tested on. They tested it on the Avengers. They didn’t test it on, you know, Joe Bag-of-Donuts … the people are actually receiving this vaccine in day to day life. And by doing that they were able to mask whatever injury might show up in a larger and more vulnerable population who are actually receiving the vaccine.  Experts used an arsenal of sloppy protocols to again, hide vaccine injuries. Among these, Merck gave report cards—the daily journal report cards— only to 10 percent of the people who they tested the vaccine on and told those people only make reports for 14 days after the injection. And the report cards were only designed to collect jab site information. So, redness, itching, bruising, fever.  And they ignored altogether the autoimmune diseases and menstrual cycle problems and fertility problems and pain and dizziness and seizures and all of the other things that we’ve now seen are associated with the vaccine. In fact, there are numerous girls who report that they were injured that they attempted to report those injuries to Merck, and that Merck rebuffed them.  Furthermore, Merck gave extraordinary discretion to its researchers to determine what was a vaccine injury in what was not a vaccine injury and because there was no inert placebo, it was completely within their discretion. If a girl came back with seizures or autoimmune disease or menstrual cycle problems they could just say to the girl, well that’s not related to the vaccine.  In some cases, we know that Merck actively covered up and lied about injuries that it had a duty to report to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. For example, in the case of Christina Tarsell, a Maryland girl, who died from the Gardasil vaccine, Merck lied about that death in its official reports of the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. It told the system that Christina’s doctor had told Merck that her death was the result of a virus.  And the doctor adamantly denies that. Merck has refused to remove the misinformation from the VAERS system.  Furthermore, Merck lied to the girls who participated in these studies, telling them No.1, that the placebo was saline and that it contained no other ingredients. And No. 2, that the study in which they were participating was not a safety study. They were told that there had already been safety studies and that the vaccine had been proven safe.  What did this do for Merck? It made it so the girls were less likely to report injuries associated with the vaccine. Because they believed that the vaccine that they were receiving had already been proven safe and that any injuries they did experience maybe a month or two months or three months after the vaccine must be simply coincidental and had nothing to do with the vaccine.  Despite all of these efforts by Merck to discourage those from reporting vaccine injuries during the clinical trials, half of the girls in the Gardasil group and half of them in the aluminum adjuvant group reported serious injuries after receiving the vaccine.  In order to conceal the link between these injuries and the vaccine, Merck invented a brand new medical metric that had never been heard of before called “new medical conditions” and it dismissed all of these new injuries which affected 50 percent of the girls who received the vaccine and the adjuvant as “new medical conditions”, unrelated to the vaccines, simply sad coincidences.  Many of these diseases were serious diseases—blood lymphatic diseases, anemia, endocrine diseases, autoimmune diseases, G.I., Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, vaginal infections musculoskeletal injuries, arthritis, neoplasm, Hodgkin’s disease, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, depression, reproductive and breast disorders, menstrual irregularities, and pain. Over 3 percent of the girls—1 in 30—in both groups required surgical and medical procedures.  So, this card game that we’re playing with Merck has now become a really bad bet.  Merck has removed the one black card but you now have a 1 in 40 chance of drawing a blue card and getting an autoimmune disease that may afflict you for the rest of your life and you have a 1 in 2 chance of having some other serious medical condition.  So now let’s look at Merck’s central claim which is that the Gardasil vaccine will prevent cervical cancer.  Merck’s in a sweet position here, let’s face it because the target group vaccine is 11-year olds, and the median age of death for cervical cancer is age 58. Merck essentially is making this bargain.  It’s telling the 11-year old girl if you take our vaccine 47 years from now you won’t die of cervical cancer. And of course, that truth is you can’t make a vaccine that proves that it’s going to prevent cancer 47 years from now. There’s no way to test for that.  So, Merck used a shortcut. It said we’re going to prove that it prevents these what it called surrogate end points. The best thing that Merck had come up with was CIN2 and CIN3 lesions which it called precancerous lesions even though most of those lesions never mature into cancer.  So how can you call something precancerous when it was never going to turn into cancer?  And here’s what a study published in the American Journal of Epidemiology said about Merck’s scheme: CIN3 is an imperfect diagnosis of precancer, and an intermediate surrogate for cancer.  Their own attorneys told them for these products, the indication is the surrogate, not the ultimate. Promotion cannot make any claim, vis-a-vis the ultimate end point, based upon the fate of a surrogate endpoint.  Merck has another problem. Recent peer reviewed scientific studies indicate that perhaps only a third of cervical cancer cases are even associated with the HPV vaccine. That would completely put the lie to Merck’s claims that Gardasil is going to eliminate cervical cancer altogether.  So now we have a really dubious deal because we need to put that black card back in the deck because now, we have doubts about whether or not this vaccine can prevent cervical cancer at all.  But the news gets worse. Gardasil may actually cause cancer. Gardasil’s insert states Gardasil has never been evaluated for potential to cause carcinogenicity or genotoxicity. And Gardasil’s ingredients include possible carcinogens including human DNA.  And look at this…This is Merck’s own pre-clinical trial records and those records show that girls or women, who already had HPV—had been exposed at some point in their life to it—actually had a negative efficacy of 44.6 percent.  What is negative efficacy? It means those girls had a 44.6 increased risk of getting those precancerous lesions. To make things even worse, there are recent scientific studies that suggest a phenomena of what is known as type replacement—some 200 different strands of HPV, some of them are more cancerous than others, and the current HPV vaccine goes after 9 of those 200 viral types. What these studies indicate is by eliminating those particular strains of the virus it opens up an ecological niche in the woman so that more lethal and virulent viruses can actually colonize that spot and dramatically increase the risk of cervical cancer.  So now Merck’s deal is looking really grim. Not only do we have a one-in-40 chance of getting an autoimmune disease and a 50 percent chance of getting some serious medical condition but now the cancer risk has been reinserted and actually amplified.  And now let’s look at some of the non-cancer injuries that Merck found in its preclinical studies.  The miscarriage rate in the preclinical studies after Gardasil doubled the background rate. The birth defects in the Gardasil group were five times the rate of birth defects from the control group. As to reproductive disorders an astonishing 10.9 percent of the women in the pool group reported reproductive disorders within seven months of receiving Gardasil compared to 1.2 percent in the placebo group. The death rate in the Gardasil group and the clinical trials was 8.5 per 10 thousand.  Death risk from this vaccine according to Merck’s own studies is 37 times the risk of dying from cervical cancer.  Oh, now look at the deal that Merck has offered us they’ve actually increased our risk of dying by 37 times.  So now let’s look at post-licensing surveillance. So, Merck can argue that we might have missed something in our pre-licensing studies but surely if there were any injuries being caused by this vaccine we would see them in post-licensing surveillance.  And the problem with that is that the post-licensing surveillance system, the principle one, is called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System. The system is a voluntary system that simply does not work. It’s broken. In fact, in 2010 HHS hired another federal agency the agency for healthcare research quality and a group of Harvard researchers to study Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System and those researchers found fewer than 1 percent of adverse events of vaccines are ever reported.  But even under that system, Gardasil has distinguished itself as the most dangerous vaccine ever invented.  In fact, when you compare it to Menactra which is a meningitis vaccine that’s given to the same age group—teenagers—Gardasil had an 8.5 times more emergency room visits, 12.5 times more hospitalizations, 10 times more life-threatening events and 26.5 times more disabilities than Menactra.  The vaccine court which is within HHS has made awards for numerous deaths and very, very serious injuries from the Gardasil vaccine. So, HHS itself admits that this vaccine kills people and it’s given compensation to the families that were injured.  The same wave of serious injuries and deaths that have been seen in nations around the globe, when they adopt mandates for the Gardasil vaccine. Even Gardasil’s own insert, the package insert that the company provides, acknowledges that the injuries that can be caused by this vaccine include death, pancreatitis, fatigue, malaise, immune system disorders, autoimmune diseases, anaphylaxis, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, nervous system disorders, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, that’s brain injuries, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neuron diseases, paralysis, seizures, Transverse myelitis, and vascular disorders.  In Australia, in 2015, the Australian Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration reported that the adverse rates in girls is 17 times the incidental rate for cervical cancer throughout their lifespan. The country only looked at a handful of conditions including demyelinating disorders, complex regional pain syndrome and premature ovarian failure. There are many, many other injuries that included hospitalizations that were not subject to that study.  India suspended its Gardasil trials after numerous deaths and serious injuries.  A south Asian Journal of Cancer found that “a healthy 16-year old is at zero immediate risk of dying from cervical cancer but is faced with a small, but real risk of death or serious disability from a vaccine that has yet to prevent a single case of cervical cancer.”  Japan de-recommended Gardasil three months after it had added the vaccine to the immunization schedule. Japan’s health ministry discovered adverse events reported after Gardasil’s approval were many times higher than other vaccines on the recommended schedule—these included seizures severe headaches partial paralysis complex regional pain syndrome and an undeniable causal relationship between persistent pain and the vaccination.  Japanese researchers found that the adverse event rate for the HPV vaccine was as high as nine percent and that pregnant women injected with the vaccine aborted or miscarried 30 percent of their babies.  In 2015 the Japanese Association for Medical Sciences issued official guidelines for managing symptoms of injuries caused by the Gardasil vaccine and the association announced there was no proof that this vaccine even prevents cervical cancer.  Alarmingly Merck’s own studies indicate that the Gardasil vaccine may disproportionately impact Asian women. For example, in protocol 19 there were 8 deaths among 3800 women and 7 those were Asians. That was 87 percent for Asian women, while only 31 percent of study participants were Asian.  Denmark in 2015 announced the opening of five new HPV clinics to treat women who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine. The day that they announced that opening there were 1300 applicants for treatment in those clinics.  In Colombia in 2014 800 girls in the town Carmen de Bolivar were grievously injured by Gardasil vaccine. Protests erupted all over Columbia. The attorney general of Colombia ordered the National Health Service of that country to immediately begin treating girls who were injured by the Gardasil vaccine and 2017 Colombia’s highest Constitutional Court ruled that the HPV vaccine would no longer be considered mandatory in Colombia and ordered that girls who showed symptoms after receiving the vaccine be given appropriate medical care.  Pompilio Martinez, who now teaches at the National University of Colombia, described the HPV vaccine as “a crime against humanity.”  Recent studies have shown that in nations with robust HPV vaccination programs and heavily vaccinated populations—in the UK and Sweden and Australia—were actually seeing dramatic upticks rises in the rate of cervical cancer rather than the downtrends that Merck promised everybody.  Now I’m going to show you some of the reasons why your pediatrician is insisting despite all of this evidence that your daughter or son gets the HPV vaccine. And the reason is the pediatrician is getting his information from agencies that have compromised through financial entanglements with Merck.  This is what the FDA is telling the public about vaccine safety: it says that vaccines are regulated by FDA and undergo a rigorous review of laboratory and clinical data to ensure the safety efficacy and purity and potency of these products.  But this is a very different story the FDA is acknowledging in-house, and this comes from a 2007 document—this is the year that Gardasil got its license from the FDA, FDA’s inability to keep up with scientific advances mean that American lives are at risk. FDA is evaluations and methods have remained largely unchanged over the last half century. The world looks to FDA as a leader today. Not only can the agency not lead, it cannot even keep up with the advances in science.  But, the most troubling problem at FDA is it has nothing to do with incompetence. It has to do with corruption. The panel within FDA that licenses new vaccines and anoints them as safe is called the Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, the acronym is VRBPAC. And in 2000 Congress investigated VRBPAC because of charges of corruption from outside the agency.  And here’s what the congressional committee found: the overwhelming majority of members, both voting members and consultants have substantial ties to the pharmaceutical industry.  Conflicts of interest rules employed by FDA have been weak enforcement has been lax. Committee members with substantial ties to pharmaceutical companies are given waivers to participate in committee proceedings. In many cases significant conflicts of interest are deemed to be in conflict at all.  And here are some specific examples of the conflict of the advisory committee that approves vaccines:  Three out of five FDA advisory committee members who voted to approve the rotavirus vaccine in December of 1997 had financial ties to the pharmaceutical companies that were developing different versions of the vaccine.  One of the five voting members had a 9 plus million dollar contract for a rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members was the principal investigator for a Merck grant to develop the rotavirus vaccine.  One of the five voting members received approximately a million dollars from vaccine manufacturers toward vaccine development.  Once they get by FDA, vaccine companies then go to CDC, where another committee, which is called ACIP Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, will then take that vaccine that FDA has licensed and they will put it on the recommended list which means it becomes essentially mandatory for 76 million American children.  A listing on CDC’s recommended list is the holy grail for vaccine companies. It ",other

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.  CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I’m Chris Wallace.  Another deadly attack in London. Britain’s prime minister condemns an evil ideology.  BEGIN VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE: We’ll get the latest in live reports from London and we’ll discuss what it means for the U.S. with Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Then, President Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord and starts a global debate.  DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh, not Paris.  WALLACE: We’ll discuss the impact on the environment, the U.S. economy and America's place in the world with Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.  And critics attack President Trump for leaving the climate deal, pointing to long-lasting consequences.  EMMANUEL MACRON, FRENCH PRESIDENT: Make our planet great again.  REP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALI., MINORITY LEADER: How was he ever going to explain to his grandchildren what he did to the air they breathe?  WALLACE: We’ll talk with one of the world's leading advocate on climate change, former Vice President Al Gore, who calls the president's withdrawal reckless and indefensible.  Pruitt and Al Gore, live, only on Fox News Sunday.  Plus, former FBI Director James Comey testifies before Congress this week about his conversations with Mr. Trump. We’ll ask our Sunday panel about what promises to be a moment of high drama.  All, right now, on Fox News Sunday.  END VIDEOTAPE  WALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  We begin with breaking news out of London, at least seven are dead and dozens injured after another terror attack targeted Britain's capital. This comes less than two weeks after a suicide bomber hit a pop concert in Manchester, England.  In a few minutes, we’ll talk with Senator Roy Blunt, member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  But we begin with Fox team coverage, Catherine Herridge on what the intelligence community is saying. But, first, senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot live from our London bureau -- Greg.  GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, for the third time in three months, terror hits the U.K. and once again, it is ugly. It was on a busy Saturday night in London as the attackers spread across London Bridge in a rented van, driving up on the walkway, smashing into pedestrians. They then ditched that vehicle a few blocks away, and armed with long knives stabbed their way through bars and restaurants nearby, with some putting up a fight.  All told, at least seven people were killed, 48 injured, many critically, including an off-duty police officer. Along with British citizens from France, Australia and elsewhere were targeted. No word yet on whether any Americans were involved.  Now, police caught up with the attackers just eight minutes later, shooting that all three, at least one had a beard, camouflage pants and a fake suicide vest. When one attack he reportedly screamed out: Praise to Allah -- the Arabic word for God.  Here is what U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May had to say today.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  THERESA MAY, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: As a country, our response must be what it has always been, when we have been confronted by violence. We must come together, we must pull together and united we will take on and defeat our enemies.  END VIDEO CLIP  PALKOT: Police now say they have arrested 12 people following raids in eastern London, said to be the home of one of the attackers. It is a sign that authorities might be on the trail of the terrorist. Police also doing a thorough forensic search of the entire terrorist site, but what is next?  Prime Minister Theresa May also said today terror breeds terror -- Chris.  WALLACE: Greg Palkot, reporting from London -- Greg, thanks for that.  Now, let's bring in chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge with the latest on who was behind the attack -- Catherine.  CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: Chris, no group is claiming responsibility this morning. But within minutes of the attack, a senior ISIS affiliated social media account pushed out slick propaganda on using vehicles as weapons, threatening more violence. It's not clear whether the ISIS posts were opportunistic or the terror group played a role. This morning, U.S. and U.K. intelligence are focused on the suspects and whether they acted alone or had a terror network behind them.  British security sources reporting that very early indications suggest the attack may have been pulled together at short notice. With the rising homegrown threat, British police are trained to quickly neutralize suspects as they did last night.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  CRESSIDA DICK, LONDON METROPOLITAN POLICE COMMISSIONER: That vehicle continued to drive from London Bridge to the borough market. The suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed. The suspects were shot dead by armed officers.  END VIDEO CLIP  HERRIDGE: Homeland Security is saying that at this time they have no information to indicate if specific credible threat to the United States. Secretary Kelly told Fox last night he worries we are, quote, right around the corner from having a similar attack but for the efforts of DHS and law enforcement agencies.  President Trump was briefed last night and spoke with the British prime minister, expressing his condolences and praising the heroic response of London police and first responders.  The president also seeming to make a political point that the attack bolstered his travel ban: We need to be smart, vigilant and tough, he tweeted. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the travel ban extra level of security -- safety.  Questions are being raised this morning about a possible intelligence failure after the British government recently lower the threat level, Chris.  WALLACE: Catherine, thank you.  HERRIDGE: You’re welcome.  WALLACE: Joining me now, Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Senator, welcome back.  SEN. ROY BLUNT, R-MISSOURI: Good to be with you.  WALLACE: What can you add to what we just heard from Catherine Herridge?  BLUNT: Well, you know, I think what we are seeing is such a broad band of potential attacks. We hear from our own intelligence community and have for years, more threats for more directions than ever before. You see the terrible Manchester bombing, those young people, mostly young women, young girls, with a fairly sophisticated bomb, based on published reports on that.  These guys have a van and kitchen knives. We think other groups are looking at more advanced kinds of attacks. So, clearly, this is from all directions, is tends to take credit for the things that you can steal a truck, get your van, drive in a car, terrorized people with very little planning or backup. Other groups we believe are looking at other things and we are constantly have to be vigilant, I think Secretary Kelly is right when he says that only because we have been fortunate and worked hard to prevent this have we not had these kinds of attacks here.  WALLACE: I want to play a clip from British Prime Minister May today. Here it is.  BGEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MAY: While the recent attacks are not connected by common networks, they are connected in one important sense. They are bound together by the single evil ideology of Islamist extremism.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Any explanation as to why we have seen three fatal terror attacks in Britain in less than three months?  BLUNT: I don't know if there's any real explanation for that, but in Paris and London and Western Europe, generally, it got people who came there to do jobs that were allowed to stay in enclaves, never became part of the society. You see the second generation of those families often turning to what the prime minister mentioned, you know, we need to say, we need to talk about it, our friends who are Muslim need to admit that this extreme sense of Islam that results in these attacks has to be called for what it is and we have to try to do what we can to intervene.  WALLACE: Do we have -- I’ve heard the argument that because we are beginning to roll back ISIS in the so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria, that there is an increased emphasis on these attacks, these kind of low technology attacks in the West. Do you think our success in one place is creating more of a threat?  BLUNT: I think you can. You know, somebody made the observation that long ago that sometimes countries implode. Syria seems to have exploded. That as things change in Syria, people have access to Europe in ways that you would otherwise want to try and do something about.  There's no way to do background checks on people that come in from communities that no longer exist, jobs that were jobs months or years ago. And so, I think we do see that. And, you know, like so many of the things that happened in Northern Africa, what people initially thought would be the result would turn out to be just the opposite.  WALLACE: As a member of the Senate Intelligence committee, any indication of an increased terror threat here in the U.S.?  BLUNT: I think the terror threat is real. You know, one of the things -- when we've seen things like San Bernardino, more often than not, U.S. officials, the FBI and others talk to these people, after months of surveillance decided they no longer needed to be under the level of watch they were and then suddenly these kinds of things happen.  I do think, again, that you've got some groups that are looking at a big play like taking down an airliner. You've got others who need very little support, very little planning, and can do incredible damage, which is actually in many ways almost more of terrorism because you go anywhere, do anything, you wonder what could happen at any moment. It could happen here --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: -- in London Bridge on a Saturday night.  BLUNT: London Bridge, the Westminster Bridge, the concert.  WALLACE: The concert, yes.  BLUNT: All of these things are true terror targets. They’re not -- it's not like going after the U.S. embassy.  WALLACE: Right.  BLUNT: They are true terror targets.  WALLACE: As Catherine mentioned just after the news broke about this terror attack, President Trump tweeted another call for his travel ban. That case is now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Do you think the justices should pay attention to the kind of thing that is happening in England and other parts of the world as they make that decision?  I mean, the fact is, in Britain, most of these terrorists have been homegrown. They've been U.K. citizens.  BLUNT: They have been. And, you know, looking at where people like that who come to our country have been is important. I’m not nearly as concerned as a lot of people are about the visa waiver program, because the visa waiver program just triggers that you can spend more time on people who you have reason to believe may have been in Libya, may have been in Syria, may have become radicalized.  I don’t know what the court will decide. I’m not a lawyer. I think my view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting. And, Christ, it’s been four -- it's been four months since I said they needed four months to put that in place. I think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are.  WALLACE: I want to talk to you about another hat as a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee. A lot of anticipation about the testimony this week from FBI -- former FBI Director James Comey, what you expect to hear from him? What questions do you have for him?  BLUNT: Well, I think it's important that we talk to everybody who should be talk to about this. I do believe that the Senate Intelligence Committee is the most likely place to bring this investigation to conclusion with whatever the conclusion turns out to be. You know, we used to dealing with each other on issues like this, so we are used to classify documents, we’re used to coming together to protect the country. Hopefully, that's what we will be able to do --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: What are you looking to ask ph from Comey?  BLUNT: We -- what Comey says and how he says that I think will be important. I haven't frankly understood much of what Comey has done since about a year ago. And his decisions have been, I think, highly questionable. We’ll see what -- why he was prepared for that meeting the way he was, said he had a round of murder board kind of questions before he went to see the president, why he thought it was important to immediately download that, and what other meetings he had that frankly he didn't think were so important to download what happen.  WALLACE: Finally, do you think that President Trump has a legitimate claim to executive privilege to block Comey from testifying? And as a practical matter, do you think he should invoke it?  BLUNT: I think the president is better served by getting all this information out. Sooner rather than later, let's find out what happened and bring this to a conclusion. You don't do that I think by invoking executive privilege on a conversation you had apparently with nobody else in the room. You know, most stories have two sides to them. At some point, we’ll hear the president’s side. But I frankly think we need to hear Mr. Comey's side and find out what other questions we need to ask after he answers the questions this week.  WALLACE: Senator Blunt, thank you. Thanks for your time this Sunday. And thank you for coming in on short notice.  BLUNT: Glad to be here.  WALLACE: Up next, President Trump's dramatic decision this week to pull out of the Paris climate accord. We’ll talk with EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a key player in the president's deliberations.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: A look outside the beltway at Pittsburgh. The president said he's looking out for residents of the former steel town in pulling out of the Paris climate deal.  International leaders, business executives and people around the world are still reacting to President Trump's decision this week. In a few minutes, we’ll talk with former Vice President Al Gore, a leading advocate on climate change.  Joining me now is Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump's administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency and a key player in the president's decision.  Mr. Pruitt, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.  SCOTT PRUITT, EPA ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning, Chris.  WALLACE: I want to start with a question that you were asked repeatedly on Friday. Here it is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  MARY BRUCE, ABC NEWS: Yes or no, does the president believe that the climate change is real and a threat to the United States?  PHILIP RUCKER, WASHINGTON POST: Does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax?  PRUITT: What's interesting about all the discussions we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue: is Paris good or not for this country?  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Let me get this straight, you and the president spent weeks discussing whether he should pull out of the Paris climate deal and you never discussed climate change?  PRUITT: It was about the merits and demerits of the deal, Chris.  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: That’s what the focus.  Look, when you look at what this country has achieved since the late 1990s-2000 time frame, we've seen an 18 percent reduction in CO2 footprint from 2000 to 2014. We’re at pre-1994 levels.  You know, what's interesting about all this criticism from the left, environment left, is if you go back to the time when the Paris deal was cut, those same groups -- in fact, James Hansen, former national scientist, called it a fake and a fraud. The general counsel of the Sierra Club was critical of what was achieved in Paris because it didn't hold China, it did not hold India accountable, and the United States agreed to 26 percent to 28 percent reductions, in CHD ph.  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: We’re going to get into all of that, but what I’m asking you is, as the president’s EPA administrator, as his point person on the environment, isn’t that a conversation that over the last few months that you have to have, whether or not climate change is real or a hoax, as the president suggested, and whether or not human activity contributes to it? Are you saying you've never had that conversation with him?  PRUITT: The focus of the last several weeks was centered --  WALLACE: I’m asking you over the last few months --  PRUITT: -- was centered on the merits and demerits of the Paris agreement. The president said -- said actually back during the campaign, that climate change occurs. I’ve said -- I’ve said during my confirmation process that climate change is occurring. That human activity contributes to it.  WALLACE: He also said it was a hoax.  PRUITT: Well, Chris, the point here, and to your question, this is something over the last several weeks, the president has received much information about the impact on jobs and also the impact on the environment. You know, we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country with respect to what we've done in reducing our CO2 footprint. It’s also --  WALLACE: I don’t want to be a --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: -- but you’re not going to tell me whether or not the president believes climate change is a hoax and whether or not human activity -- it's a simple question.  PRUITT: The president has indicated that the climate changes. It's always changing. I’ve indicated the same.  WALLACE: Well, that’s the same --  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: What's important, Chris, here -- what’s important is what the president did on Thursday is put America first and say to the United States and say to the world that we’re going to remain engaged, but we’re also going to make sure that as we remain engage, we put America’s interest first.  WALLACE: As you pointed out, the president justified pulling out of the Paris deal largely on economic terms. Here he is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: The American family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But the study that the president cited was funded by two groups that are dramatically opposed to environmental regulation and the study itself acknowledges it does -- this is a quote from the study -- it does not take into account the potential benefits from avoided emissions. The study results are not a benefit-cost analysis of climate change.  PRUITT: Well, there were several --  WALLACE: Administrator, it is a worst-case scenario.  PRUITT: There were several studies that were actually published in response to Paris. NERA, the Heritage study, the Global Policy publication --  WALLACE: You specifically quoted NERA.  PRUITT: There were several and -- that were sourced aspects as part of the speech.  And what we know from the Paris agreement objectively is that it was a $2.5 trillion contraction to our economy over ten years. What we do know is it impacted up to 400,000 jobs in this country. What we do know is it impacted both the manufacturing base and energy sector jobs.  You know, since last -- the fourth quarter of 2016, Chris, we've had almost 50,000 jobs created in the mining and coal sector alone. In fact, in the month of May, almost 7,000 jobs.  So, these individuals that are -- I think what’s also being missed here is that when you look at how we generate electricity in this country, the power grid. We need to feel diversity. We need coal, natural gas, hydro, renewables, nuclear, as part of that mix, because it provides stability and strength to our grid and lower cost. Our price per kilowatt compared to Germany, our price per kilowatt compared to Europe is far better and it helps us grow jobs in this country.  WALLACE: Mr. Pruitt, aren’t you focusing on the wrong thing?  I want to put up some, I’m going to say, surprising statistics. Take a look at this -- the U.S. now employs more than double the number of people in the solar industry than it does in coal. Aren’t you and the president talking about protecting the horse and buggy business just as cars come online?  PRUITT: Absolutely not, because as I just indicated, we need hydro -- we need hydrocarbon stored on-site at utility companies across this country to address something, attacks on our grid, attacks on infrastructure, if we have peaked demand needs, you want a diversity of fuels that generate electricity. It is bad business -- it is bad business for a country to limit the --  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: President Trump talks about protecting the people of Pittsburgh. The mayor of Pittsburgh said we’re not a steel town anymore, we’re a green town and, in fact, he rejected what the president said. And the mayor of Pittsburgh, the city he specifically cited, said, we’re going to comply with the Paris climate accord.  PRUITT: This president has said that we truly need an all-of-the-above approach. We should not penalize sectors of our economy, Chris. Government regulation shouldn't be used to pick winners and losers. The past administration declared a war on coal and there were several coal facilities across the country shut down because of their past efforts. That is not what government regulation should be about.  Government regulation should be about making things regular, not picking winners and losers, and making sure we have fuel diversity and generating electricity in this country. And as I indicated, the jobs numbers show already, already, that this president's deregulatory agenda, his leadership in the energy space is making a difference for jobs across this country, almost 50,000 in the coal sector --  WALLACE: I want to go to another issue, because the president also said that the Paris climate accord and pulling out of it isn't going to make all that much difference on the environment. Here he is.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: With total compliance from all nations, it is estimated it would only produce a two-tenths of one degree -- think of that, this much.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But the people behind the MIT study, that study that he just cited say that he took a number from 2014 before the targets for the Paris accord were even reached. And the cofounder of the program said this about the White House: They found a number that made the point they want to make. It’s kind of a debate trick.  The people behind the study the president cited say, look, Paris isn’t going to solve everything. It isn’t going to solve global warming, but it makes an important contribution.  PRUITT: What short memories these folks have. What short memories they have.  James Hansen, former NASA scientist, the father of climate change, he's been called, called Paris a fake and a fraud, because of the very things the president cited. Two-tenths of one -- there are other studies. The Global Policy publication came out criticizing --  WALLACE: Are you going to speak to what the MIT authors --  CROSSTALK  PRUITT: Look, it’s very fishy to me that MIT updated their study or their results after we started citing it. No one is questioning their methodology. Nobody’s questioning their findings.  WALLACE: Well, in fact, you didn’t cite their study after Paris. You cited their study before Paris, in 2014.  PRUITT: What's interesting, Chris, is during the time before Paris, before Paris, this country reduce their CO2 footprint by over 18 percent, from 2000 to 2014. What does that demonstrate? It demonstrates that American innovation, American technology is leading the way with respect to reducing the CO2 footprint, not government mandate.  If China and India want to reduce their CO2 footprint, they should learn from us.  WALLACE: Well --  PRUITT: India, by the way, in the Paris agreement, talk about the merits of the deal, Chris, conditioned any steps that they would take on receiving $2.5 trillion of aid. China agreed to make no steps until the year 2030. They’re the largest polluters in the world.  WALLACE: Let me -- let me pick up on that because you've taken me exactly where I want to go.  CROSSTALK  WALLACE: Yes, this is working together.  The president had one more big complaint about Paris and he said that it treats the U.S. unfairly.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: China will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants. So, we can't build the plants, but they can, according to this agreement. India will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: But here again, sir, the reality is different, is very different from what the president said. China has canceled plans for more than 100 coal plants and promises 20 percent of its energy consumption will be green by 2030. India has pledged 40 percent of its energy will be renewable by 2030. And it’s set to pass Japan this year as the world's third-largest market for solar power.  So, it may not mandate it in the Paris agreement, but, in fact, China and India are going green already.  PRUITT: You know, what’s interesting -- one of the keywords that was up on the screen was plans. China was actually building over 360 new coal generation facilities and had 800 planned, Chris. So, maybe they've drawn back on the number that are planned, but they’re burning coal. And they’re going to continue to burn coal.  WALLACE: Well, we are burning coal.  PRUITT: Just for foreseeable future.  We’ve got a contraction with respect to our grid, quite substantially. We used to be well above 40 percent. We’re now down around 30 percent, if not less.  So, this country has frontloaded its costs. The rest of the world said, hey, we’ll get to that later. They applauded when -- when we joined Paris, the rest of the world applauded, not because of climate reductions, but because it put this country at an economic disadvantage. We -- the Clean Power Plan alone, the Clean Power Plan alone represented almost $300 million of compliance cost to our economy.  So, why wouldn’t Paris -- excuse me, why wouldn’t France and these other countries want us to stay in that kind of deal? It's a bad deal for this country. The president didn't say, by the way, that we weren’t going to continue engagement. The president -- he said Paris represents a bad deal for this country.  WALLACE: He also said we’re going to renegotiate and all of the leaders around the world, certainly in Europe, said: forget it.  PRUITT: Well, then, he also said, either a new deal or as part of the Paris agreement.  But we’re already part -- look, we are the United States, Chris. We don't lose our seat at the table. We joined the treaty in 1992, called the UNFCCC, with respect to climate change.  WALLACE: All right.  PRUITT: And that is still there. We’re going to remain engaged internationally, but we’re going to make sure that as we make deals, that we put the interest of America first. This was applauded by small business.  You know, it was interesting. The New York Times yesterday had an article that a small business that applauded --  WALLACE: I don't want you to filibuster so we can't get to Al Gore. We want to get to him.  PRUITT: OK.  WALLACE: You brought up a lot of legitimate points I’m going to ask him about.  Mr. Pruitt, thank you for your time. Always good to talk with you.  PRUITT: Thank you.  WALLACE: And thank you for answering our questions.  PRUITT: Thanks, Chris.  WALLACE: That's what it's all about.  Up next, former Vice President Al Gore on Mr. Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris accord.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: Coming up, former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before Congress this week about his conversations with the president.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-SOUTH CAROLINA: I hope this hearing doesn't become a hitch on President Trump. There's a cloud over the presidency that needs to be removed.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: We’ll ask our Sunday panel what to expect.  COMMERCIAL BREAK  WALLACE: Former Vice President Al Gore's breakthrough documentary, An Inconvenient Truth, brought the topic of climate change to the forefront. Not surprisingly, he is one of the sharpest critics of Mr. Trump's decision this week. We welcome him for what we believe is his first appearance on Fox News since the 2000 campaign.  Mr. Vice President, good to have you back.  AL GORE, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Great to be back, Chris. Thank you for inviting me.  WALLACE: Before we get to climate change, I want to ask you about this terrible attack in London. How do we stop these attacks on the west and is President Trump's travel been part of the answer?  GORE: Well, most of the attacks, both in England and here in the United States, have been by homegrown terrorists. And, of course, the courts will deal with the travel ban. They've already been struck down. We’ll see what the Supreme Court does.  This surge of terrorism, we -- we have to defeat it, but we have to defeat it not only with the force of arms, but with the force of our values. And I truly believe that giving people around the world a sense that the world’s got our act together and we’re going to move forward to a bright future is one of the important tasks at hand.  WALLACE: Let's turn to the subject at hand.  You met with President-elect Trump during the transition to discuss climate change and afterwards you said this.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  GORE: I had a -- a lengthy and very productive session with the president-elect. It was a sincere search for areas of common ground.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: You also talked with Mr. Trump, we’re told, last month about staying in the Paris climate deal. Did you misjudge the president?  GORE: Well, I've kept my communications with him confidential. I think that's the right way to handle it. But none of it would surprise you. I did my best to persuade him it was in our country's best interest to stay in the Paris agreement. I -- I thought there was a chance that he would do that. I'm sorry that he made the other decision.  WALLACE: How do you explain it?  GORE: Well, you’d have to ask him for the explanation. It makes no sense to me. I think that it was a reckless decision, and indefensible decision. I think it undermines our nations standing in the world and isolates us and threatens to harm humanity's ability to solve this crisis in time.  But, make no mistake about it, the -- this country is going to continue to solve the climate crisis. Governors like Jerry Brown and Andrew Cuomo, Jay Inslee, many others, mayors, Mike Bloomberg’s doing a great job rallying mayors around the country. We are going to continue reducing emissions. Atlanta just decided to go 100 percent renewable and there are many, many others.  WALLACE: Let’s talk -- and I -- you heard me challenge Scott Pruitt. I’m going to challenge you. Let's talk about some of the concerns that people have about Paris. President Trump talked about one.  BEGIN VIDEO CLIP  TRUMP: It includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States through the so-called green climate fund, nice name.  END VIDEO CLIP  WALLACE: Under the Paris Accord, 37 developed countries agreed to provide $100 billion to developing countries. Why is that fair?  GORE: Well, you know, when the Marshall Plan was launched by the United States after World War II, it ended up benefiting us tremendously, as well as making the world a better place. We would have been -- we would be 11th on the list of nations per capita in -- in helping the country to meet this climate challenge. And, by the way, one of the opportunities for us is to export our products and create more jobs here. You showed some jobs in the solar industry earlier. Solar jobs are now growing 17 times faster than other jobs. It's the brightest spot. If we get out there in the economy, if we get out there and help lead the sustainability revolution, it benefits our economy.  WALLACE: But here's the thing -- problem I think a lot of people have. Countries like the U.S., which have been developing an industrial economy since the 19th century, the argument is that somehow we owe something to countries that didn't.  GORE: Well, it’s a global challenge in the world community as a whole has to -- has to face up to it. This administration has said there's no such thing as a global community. Actually, there is, because we, as a civilization, are putting 110 million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution up into the sky every day as if it's an open sewer.  And, you know, the climate crisis is real, Chris. I -- I’m -- I'm sure you know that. President Trump won't say whether he bel",partially false
289d959a,Employers are often unwilling to hire someone convicted of a crime. That's a problem — and it needs to change.,"By Governor Andrew M. Cuomo and Jostein Solheim, CEO of Ben & Jerry’s  Employers can often be hesitant to hire someone with a criminal conviction. Unsubstantiated rumors of increased violence in the workplace, theft, or incompetence often stand in the way of giving someone with a record a chance. Yet employers that do hire formerly incarcerated individuals end up reaping the benefits: loyal employees with higher retention rates, tax benefits, and increased economic mobility for their staff.  70 million Americans have a criminal record—that’s 1 in 3 adults. There are currently 2.3 million people behind bars in this country, 95 percent of whom will reenter our communities. 640,000 people are released from prison each year, creating a huge untapped workforce available to fill jobs. Yet, in New York State, 53 percent of people on parole have yet to find a job. Employers are often uncomfortable hiring people who have been convicted of a crime—one study found that, in New York City, a criminal record reduced the likelihood of a callback or job offer by nearly 50 percent.  This is a problem. Joblessness is the number one predictor of recidivism—the less likely it is for a formerly incarcerated person to find a job, the more likely it is that they end up back in prison, with all the costs associated with incarceration, including a price tag of $60,000 per inmate per year in New York. These barriers to reentry have a negative trickle effect not only on the lives of these individuals, preventing them from providing for themselves and their families, but on society as a whole. Studies have shown that excluding formerly incarcerated individuals from the workforce results in a GDP loss of $78-87 billion thanks to lost tax revenue, and that if states can reduce recidivism rates by just 10 percent, they could save an average of $635 million annually.  That’s why my administration has launched the Work for Success Pledge—an online pledge in which companies, like Ben and Jerry’s or VICE Media, whose VICE Apprenticeship Program hires and trains formerly incarcerated people for production, editorial and creative jobs at the company, commit to consider hiring qualified candidates with criminal convictions. New York is the first state in the nation to develop such a pledge. So far, 80 companies have signed on and shown their commitment to hiring those with a criminal conviction—but we need more to pledge their support! It just makes good business sense.  Companies like Ben & Jerry’s recognize that hiring formerly incarcerated individuals and working with suppliers that do the same is important for our business, our culture, and our bottom line. Studies have shown that those with a criminal conviction can often make the best employees—they are retained at higher rates than those with no criminal record, saving companies costs associated with hiring and training, which can be as much as $4,000 per employee. Additionally, companies that hire people with criminal convictions are eligible for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit WOTC, which provides a maximum tax credit of $2,400 per employee.  Formerly incarcerated individuals are often the most motivated at work. A study of army enlistees found that enlistees with felony records were 33 percent more likely to be promoted to sergeant than those with no conviction history, a testament to their dedication and motivation.  Ben & Jerry’s is incredibly proud of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers. It was Ben who heard about the bakery and came up with one of our most successful flavors, Chocolate Fudge Brownie, specifically to allow our company to work with and expand the impact of the baker which, through its open hiring process, has helped thousands of returning citizens and their families rebuild their lives and their dignity. It is in part because of our long relationship with the Greyston Bakery that we’ve made changes to our hiring and recruiting process so that people are judged by their skill and qualifications, not the mistakes of the past. There is no doubt, with 1 in 3 Americans having been convicted of a crime, if we were to use criminal conviction as screen for recruiting, we would be leaving very qualified candidates out of our process. That’s just a bad business decision.  Across New York, the Cuomo administration has long been dedicated to providing employment for those with criminal convictions. In 2012, we launched the Work for Success Program, which matches qualified and appropriately trained job applicants with criminal convictions to open job listings. In the last five years, we have placed more than 18,000 people in jobs, and each new company that signs on to our Work for Success Pledge also commits to listing job openings with the program.  In 2015, the Council on Community Reentry and Reintegration took further steps to ensure equity in hiring by setting uniform guidelines that evaluate qualified applicants for state occupational licenses and adopting “fair chance hiring” for New York State agencies, meaning agencies will not ask about a job applicant’s criminal convictions until and unless the agency has interviewed the candidate and is interested in hiring him or her. As a result of Reentry Council efforts in 2016, New York is also the first in the nation to prohibit insurance companies from denying insurance coverage to businesses that hire people with criminal convictions.  These are small steps that can make a huge difference. Together, by signing the Work for Success Pledge, businesses have a real opportunity to not only provide a helping hand to those who have been cut off from opportunities, but to also improve our bottom line. New York State is dedicated to creating a true “state of opportunity” for everyone.",partially false
74604cc9,"Smoke fags, save lives","There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for.",other
46c63178,"99.96% of people who received two Pfizer doses did not develop Covid, research in Israel suggests","Israeli research has found that just 0.04 per cent of those vaccinated with both doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine went on to develop coronavirus  Almost all cases of Covid are prevented with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, research suggests.  Data gathered in Israel – which is leading the world in the vaccine rollout – found that just 0.04 per cent of those vaccinated with both doses went on to develop coronavirus.  Of 700,000 people who were vaccinated, just 300 later contracted the virus, with only 16 requiring hospital treatment, according to preliminary data released by Israeli health officials.  The vaccine also protects against the more infectious UK variant of Covid-19, the research suggests.  Professor Eyal Leshem, an Israeli infectious diseases specialist, said the reports were 'very good news'. He added: 'The initial findings are quite incredible.  Almost all cases of Covid are prevented with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, research suggests. Data gathered in Israel – which is leading the world in the vaccine rollout – found that just 0.04 per cent of those vaccinated with both doses went on to develop coronavirus. Pictured: A man receives a dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Tel Aviv, Israel on Tuesday  'After one dose, the cases fell substantially and after two, there were just 0.4 per cent.  'Time will tell, we still need to accumulate data but these are very encouraging preliminary reports.'  More than 30 per cent of Israel's population has received a vaccine, with several studies into its effectiveness under way.  Professor Leshem added: 'On one hand, we're seeing very high community transmission rates with 1,000s of cases every day - the highest rates we've experienced since the beginning of the outbreak.  'But when we look specifically at these hundreds of thousands of Israelis that are vaccinated, they don't get infected.  Pictured: Health workers from the Maccabi Health vaccination centre administer doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine inside the car park of the Givatayim mall in Tel Aviv, Israel on Tuesday  'And even in those few cases that get infected, they experience a mild disease - only a handful need to go to the hospital, only a handful experienced severe disease and needed to be admitted to the hospital.  'It's what we call real life, ecologic evidence of vaccine efficacy - the high efficacy of the vaccine.'  The majority of those vaccinated were over 60, making the results even more remarkable, he added.  Initial studies have also found a significant reduction in cases among those who have had one dose of the vaccine.  Israel is providing Pfizer with weekly data updates on its vaccine campaign under as part of a collaboration agreement.",false

074f1245,Romney Endorses Joe Biden,"After his unsuccessful run for President against Barack Obama, Mitt Romney hasn’t exactly acted like the Republican’s Republican. He’s voted against several pieces of GOP legislation while representing the state of Utah in the Senate, and he was the only voice of the conservative right to correctly recommend that Donald Trump be charged and prosecuted for crimes during his historic impeachment trial. Now, however, his seemingly turncoat antics may have gone too far. Like someone giving Melania Trump an American Express Gold Card at the Bunny Ranch.  Just this morning, at the Brigham Young pagoda of Utah’s Sandy Batt Fellowship Hall, the Informin’ Mormon told a gathered press corps that he would be endorsing candidate Joe Biden for the 2020 Presidential election over incumbent and fellow Republican Donald Trump. His ten minute long speech excoriated the beleaguered pandemic-botching fumbletwat and left supporters cold:  “I cannot, in good faith, and with hands raised to Heavenly Father, throw any manner of assistance towards the President and risk having four more years of his ineptitude and sheer criminality screwing over our country. Joe Biden is at least sane, capable, and not Representitive of Nazis and racists. I intend to contribute my, and my State’s efforts to the rising Joementum movement in order to save America from a severely mentally handicapped evil gorilla and his pea-brained followers. Amen.”  Romney not only intends to privately endorse Biden, but has also funded millions of dollars worth of political advertisements for his campaign in an effort to swing his state to blue. So far, it seems to be working, as 4 of 5 latter-day saints registered to vote in the Caucasianest State have expressed fealty towards the overly vanilla Dem. It appears that Mitt Romney may end up being the wild card of the election. Which would mark the one and only time the senator would have the word “Wild” in any way associated with him.",false
db6e61ba,Trump Attorney Lin Wood Puts GA Gov Brian Kemp On Notice: “Accountability for wrongdoing is called JUSTICE”," In Georgia, a hand recount of the votes just found 2,600 ballots that had not yet been counted in Floyd County. The uncounted votes have netted an additional 800 votes for President Trump.*  Just the News – Apparently, the county election officials didn’t upload votes in a ballot-scanning machine, which the state’s voting system manager Gabriel Sterling called “an amazing blunder.” He said the county’s elections director should resign.  Meanwhile, GA Governor Brian Kemp is getting a lot of heat from Republicans for his handling of the election, in particular, for his relationship with the Dominion Voting Systems lobbyist, who, according to the American Thinker, pitched the $100 million dollar purchase of these machines, was Georgia Governor Brian Kemp’s former chief of staff.

d2d3b970,Ofsted admits some 'outstanding schools aren't that good',"Some schools rated outstanding may no longer be as good as their rating suggests, Ofsted has said amid official criticism of its work in England.  A National Audit Office report found 1,620 schools, mostly outstanding, had not been inspected for six years or more, and 290 for a decade or more.  Outstanding schools were decreed exempt from routine inspections in 2011.  Ofsted bosses said there was no way of telling if these schools had since fallen into a mediocre category.  Although, inspections can be triggered at any school if a safeguarding concern is raised, or if there is a significant drop in results.  It no longer goes into these top-rated schools on a regular basis. 'Effectiveness reduced'  Ofsted's director of corporate strategy, Luke Tryl, said: What we can't tell is if the levels of education in those schools judged outstanding 10 years ago are the same or whether it has changed to become middling, or mediocre or coasting.  When asked by reporters if he was saying that some outstanding schools aren't really outstanding, he replied: Yes.  However, many schools will have their outstanding label highlighted on their websites and on banners outside their premises.  And many parents base at least their initial views of such schools on these Ofsted rankings. data pic  The NAO found the inspectorate's effectiveness has reduced as a result of the decision by the Department for Education and Ofsted to end routine inspections for outstanding and good schools.  Ofsted said it had since been lobbying the DfE to reinstate routine inspections every six years for a primary schools and every five or seven years for a secondary.  Schools minister Nick Gibb said: If Ofsted has reason to believe a school is no longer meeting its previous high standards, we would expect it to use its powers to carry out a full inspection - this has always been the case - and remains so.  He added that the inspectorate was given £40m a year to provide a school inspection regime that is focused on the schools that need the most improvement. Lack of inspectors  Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said most parents were savvy enough to look at a range of evidence on school effectiveness and did not just rely on Ofsted rankings.  His organisation has also been arguing for inspections of outstanding schools to be reinstated, calling for one every five years or so. Pupils in science classimage copyrightGetty Images  The schools inspectorate was also found to have missed its own targets on the re-inspection of the weakest schools - those rated inadequate.  The target of 24 months for such a re-inspection had been missed in 6% of cases, 78 schools, between 2012 and 2016, the NAO said.  These schools would have weak teaching, weak leadership and possibly some behaviour issues, Ofsted said.  The NAO report said: Ofsted has extended some of the targets to allow schools more time to improve.  This has also allowed Ofsted to spread re-inspections over a longer period.  But Ofsted told the NAO it had found it difficult to meet its inspection targets because of cuts to its budget and because it did not have enough inspectors.  In 2015, it took a decision to bring all its inspectors in house after a string of complaints about inspections that had been contracted out to private companies.  This had left it with a shortfall of inspectors, although this had improved in 2016-17, the NAO said. 'Cuts and shifts'  Matthew Coffey, Ofsted's chief operations officer, defended the decision to effectively reduce the number of inspectors, saying it was taken on quality grounds.  But he added that some of its most senior inspectors, HMIs her majesty's inspectors, had left to run some of the numerous multi-academy trust chains being formed at the time.  He said: Becoming an HMI used to be a traditional end of career role, and it's not like that any more.  It was a challenge, he said, to compete with academy trusts able to pay salaries of £100,000 or more.  HMIs were paid about £70,000, he said.  Amyas Morse, the head of the NAO, said: The fact that Ofsted has been subject to constant cuts over more than a decade, and regular shifts in focus, speaks volumes.  It indicates a lack of clarity about how best to obtain assurance about the quality of schools.  The department needs to be mindful that cheaper inspection is not necessarily better inspection.  To demonstrate its commitment, the department needs a clear vision for school inspection and to resource it accordingly.  Nick Brook, NAHT deputy general secretary, said it was essential to hold schools to account, but the current system was muddled.  Schools and parents alike will be concerned to read that the NAO has concluded that the level of independent assurance about schools' effectiveness has reduced. Confidence in the quality and reliability of inspection is of paramount importance to all.  ",true
1ea1d474,Parents of truants to have benefits docked,"Parents in England who refuse to pay a penalty after their children play truant will have their child benefit docked, the prime minister has said.  A civil penalty of up to £120 would be claimed through child benefit if the fine is not paid after 28 days. Currently, just over half of fines are paid in that period.  David Cameron told BBC Breakfast it was about making sure children get the great start in life that they need.  Teaching unions said docking child benefit could end up hurting children.  Follow live coverage of the Conservative Party conference  The existing system sees non-payment of the £60 civil penalty in England being doubled to £120 after 21 days, and subject to prosecution after 28 days. But many parents do not end up in court because councils do not take legal action.  David Cameron said the system must be changed because truancy was harmful to children's life chances.  All the evidence is that if children consistently miss school, they get a worse education, they get worse results and as a result they have less good prospects for the rest of their lives, he told BBC Breakfast.  So this is about making sure our children get the great future and the great start in life that they need. A police officer talking to a youthimage copyrightMet Police  At the Conservative Party conference in Manchester, he is expected to say: There is nothing responsible about allowing your child to go without an education.  So for parents who let their child play truant and refuse to pay truancy penalties, we will deduct it from their child benefit. Care requests  The Press Association says it obtained figures earlier this year which showed 16,430 people in England were prosecuted last year for failing to ensure that a child went to school.  About three-quarters - 12,479 - of these were found guilty, and courts issued 9,214 parents with fines worth an average of £172.  Mr Cameron first spoke of the idea of cutting benefits for parents of regular truants in September 2011.  And a key government adviser on school behaviour called for the same measure in April 2012.  But Chris Keates, general secretary of the teachers union NASUWT, said docking benefits was not the answer.  For some families all that this will do, of course, is increase the chaos and it will increase the deprivation, she said.  It won't actually solve the problem and in the middle of all of this is a child who's not getting their entitlement to education...  Meanwhile, the prime minister will also announce a new right for parents in England to request that schools provide breakfast and after-school clubs or holiday care.  Schools will not be obliged to provide these when asked, but will have to publish reasons why they do not respond to such requests from parents or childcare providers.  This will apply to all state-maintained primary schools, as well as new academies and free schools.  Update 8 October 2015: We have amended a figure in this report to clarify the number of fines that are paid within 28 days.  ",false
5331f61c,"Joe Arpaio, America’s Toughest Sheriff, Dead at 89","Joe Arpaio, former Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, has died at the age of 89. Best known for being sued for various violations of the Constitution, not investigating sexual crimes against children, buying a tank, ignoring court orders, being incoherent at the 2016 Republican National Convention, and spying on a Federal judge’s wife, the former Sheriff was seeking to be back in the public eye.  The former sheriff was focused on being re-elected, believing the voters of the county to be gullible fools who missed him. Since Arizona voted for Donald Trump in 2016, he definitely had a chance.  Arpaio reportedly collapsed when he tried to chase a brown person out of his neighborhood in the Maryvale district of Phoenix.  County coroner Joe Barron performed the autopsy and spoke with our own Glenn Stanley,  “We were floored. We were thinking heart attack. We couldn’t find a heart, nor any evidence that there ever was a heart in Arpaio’s body.  It turns out that the actual cause of death was due to a lack of anyone paying attention to him. After he was pardoned by Trump for investigating a judge, he had a laughable run for Senate.  After everyone was done laughing at him, he faded into fatal obscurity.”  The burial of the Sheriff is expected to be attended by 3 or 4 people, including David Duke and Pamela Geller, who are afraid of the same things that Arpaio also hated.  President Trump reached out with a note to Joe Arpaio to get well but then retracted saying, “I like former sheriffs that didn’t die.”",false
e01f532a,“No one has died from the coronavirus”,"Rosemary Frei and Patrick Corbett  A high-profile European pathologist is reporting that he and his colleagues across Europe have not found any evidence of any deaths from the novel coronavirus on that continent.  Dr. Stoian Alexov called the World Health Organization WHO a “criminal medical organization” for creating worldwide fear and chaos without providing objectively verifiable proof of a pandemic.  Another stunning revelation from Bulgarian Pathology Association BPA president Dr. Alexov is that he believes it’s currently “impossible” to create a vaccine against the virus.  He also revealed that European pathologists haven’t identified any antibodies that are specific for SARS-CoV-2.  These stunning statements raise major questions, including about officials’ and scientists’ claims regarding the many vaccines they’re rushing into clinical trials around the world.  They also raise doubt about the veracity of claims of discovery of anti-novel-coronavirus antibodies which are beginning to be used to treat patients.  Novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies are supposedly the basis for the expensive serology test kits being used in many countries some of which have been found to be unacceptably inaccurate.  And they’re purportedly key to the immunity certificates coveted by Bill Gates that are about to go into widespread use — in the form of the COVI-PASS — in 15 countries including the UK, US, and Canada.  Dr. Alexov made his jaw-dropping observations in a video interview summarizing the consensus of participants in a May 8, 2020, European Society of Pathology ESP webinar on COVID-19.  The May 13 video interview of Dr. Alexov was conducted by Dr. Stoycho Katsarov, chair of the Center for Protection of Citizens’ Rights in Sofia and a former Bulgarian deputy minister of health. The video is on the BPA’s website, which also highlights some of Dr. Alexov’s main points.  We asked a native Bulgarian speaker with a science background to orally translate the video interview into English. We then transcribed her translation. The video is here and our English transcript is here.  Among the major bombshells Dr. Alexov dropped is that the leaders of the May 8 ESP webinar said no novel-coronavirus-specific antibodies have been found.  The body forms antibodies specific to pathogens it encounters. These specific antibodies are known as monoclonal antibodies and are a key tool in pathology. This is done via immunohistochemistry, which involves tagging antibodies with colours and then coating the biopsy- or autopsy-tissue slides with them. After giving the antibodies time to bind to the pathogens they’re specific for, the pathologists can look at the slides under a microscope and see the specific places where the coloured antibodies — and therefore the pathogens they’re bound to – are located.  Therefore, in the absence of monoclonal antibodies to the novel coronavirus, pathologists cannot verify whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in the body, or whether the diseases and deaths attributed to it indeed were caused by the virus rather than by something else.  It would be easy to dismiss Dr. Alexov as just another crank ‘conspiracy theorist.’ After all many people believe they’re everywhere these days, spreading dangerous misinformation about COVID-19 and other issues.  In addition, little of what Dr. Alexov alleges was the consensus from the May 8 webinar is in the publicly viewable parts of the proceedings.  But keep in mind that whistleblowers often stand alone because the vast majority of people are afraid to speak out publicly.  Also, Dr. Alexov has an unimpugnable record and reputation. He’s been a physician for 30 years. He’s president of the BPA, a member of the ESP’s Advisory Board and head of the histopathology department at the Oncology Hospital in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia.  On top of that, there’s other support for what Dr. Alexov is saying.  For example, the director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany said in media interviews that there’s a striking dearth of solid evidence for COVID-19’s lethality.  “COVID-19 is a fatal disease only in exceptional cases, but in most cases it is a predominantly harmless viral infection,” Dr. Klaus Püschel told a German paper in April. Adding in another interview:  In quite a few cases, we have also found that the current corona infection has nothing whatsoever to do with the fatal outcome because other causes of death are present, for example, a brain hemorrhage or a heart attack […] [COVID-19 is] not particularly dangerous viral disease […] All speculation about individual deaths that have not been expertly examined only fuel anxiety.”  Also, one of us Rosemary and another journalist, Amory Devereux, documented in a June 9 Off-Guardian article that the novel coronavirus has not fulfilled Koch’s postulates.  These postulates are scientific steps used to prove whether a virus exists and has a one-to-one relationship with a specific disease. We showed that to date no one has proven SARS-CoV-2 causes a discrete illness matching the characteristics of all the people who ostensibly died from COVID-19. Nor has the virus has been isolated, reproduced and then shown to cause this discrete illness.  In addition, in a June 27 Off-Guardian article two more journalists, Torsten Engelbrecht and Konstantin Demeter, added to the evidence that “the existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact.”  The pair also confirmed “there is no scientific proof that those RNA sequences [deemed to match that of the novel coronavirus] are the causative agent of what is called COVID-19.”  Dr. Alexov stated in the May 13 interview that:  the main conclusion [of those of us who participated in the May 8 webinar] was that the autopsies that were conducted in Germany, Italy, Spain, France and Sweden do not show that the virus is deadly.”  He added that:  What all of the pathologists said is that there’s no one who has died from the coronavirus. I will repeat that: no one has died from the coronavirus.”  Dr. Alexov also observed there is no proof from autopsies that anyone deemed to have been infected with the novel coronavirus died only from an inflammatory reaction sparked by the virus presenting as interstitial pneumonia rather than from other potentially fatal diseases.  Another revelation of his is that:  “We need to see exactly how the law will deal with immunization and that vaccine that we’re all talking about, because I’m certain it’s [currently] not possible to create a vaccine against COVID. I’m not sure what exactly Bill Gates is doing with his laboratories – is it really a vaccine he’s producing, or something else?”  As pointed to above, the inability to identify monoclonal antibodies for the virus suggests there is no basis for the vaccines, serological testing and immunity certificates being rolled out around the globe at unprecedented speed and cost. In fact, there is no solid evidence the virus exists.  Dr. Alexov made still more important points. For example, he noted that, in contrast to the seasonal influenza, SARS-CoV-2 hasn’t been proven to kill youth:  [With the flu] we can find one virus which can cause a young person to die with no other illness present […] In other words, the coronavirus infection is an infection that does not lead to death. And the flu can lead to death.”  There have been reports of severe maladies such as Kawasaki-like disease and stroke in young people who were deemed to have a novel-coronavirus infection. However, the majority of published papers on these cases are very short and include only one or only a small handful of patients. Moreover, commenters on the papers note it’s impossible to determine the role of the virus because the papers’ authors did not control sufficiently, if at all, for confounding factors. It’s most likely that children’s deaths attributed to COVID-19 in fact are from multiple organ failure resulting from the combination of the drug cocktail and ventilation that these children are subjected to.  Dr. Alexov therefore asserted that:  the WHO is creating worldwide chaos, with no real facts behind what they’re saying.”  Among the myriad ways the WHO is creating that chaos is by prohibiting almost all autopsies of people deemed to have died from COVID-19. As a result, reported Dr. Alexov, by May 13 only three such autopsies had been conducted in Bulgaria.  Also, the WHO is dictating that everyone said to be infected with the novel coronavirus who subsequently dies must have their deaths attributed to COVID-19.  “That’s quite stressful for us, and for me in particular, because we have protocols and procedures which we need to use,” he told Dr. Katsarov. “…And another pathologist 100 years from now is going to say, ‘Hey, those pathologists didn’t know what they were doing [when they said the cause of death was COVID-19]!’ So we need to be really strict with our diagnoses, because they could be proven [or disproven], and they could be checked again later.”  He disclosed that pathologists in several countries in Europe, as well as in China, Australia and Canada are strongly resisting the pressure on them to attribute deaths to COVID-19 alone:  I’m really sad that we need to follow the [WHO’s] instructions without even thinking about them. But in Germany, France, Italy and England they’re starting to think that we shouldn’t follow the WHO so strictly, and [instead] when we’re writing the cause of death we should have some pathology [results to back that up] and we should follow the protocol. [That’s because] when we say something we need to be able to prove it.”  He added that autopsies could have helped confirm or disprove the theory that many of the people deemed to have died of COVID-19 in Italy had previously received the H1N1 flu vaccine. Because, as he noted, the vaccine suppresses adults’ immune systems and therefore may have been a significant contributor to their deaths by making them much more susceptible to infection.  Drs. Alexov and Katsarov agreed that yet another aspect of the WHO-caused chaos and its fatal consequences is many people are likely to die soon from diseases such as cancer because the lockdowns, combined with the emptying of hospitals ostensibly to make room for COVID-19 patients, halted all but the most pressing procedures and treatments.  They also observed these diseases are being exacerbated by the fear and chaos surrounding COVID-19.  We know that stress significantly suppresses the immune system, so I can really claim 200% that all the chronic diseases will be more severe and more acute per se. Specifically in situ carcinoma – over 50% of these are going to become more invasive […] So I will say that this epidemic isn’t so much an epidemic of the virus, it’s an epidemic of giving people a lot of fear and stress.”  In addition, posited Dr. Alexov, as another direct and dire result of the pandemic panic many people are losing faith in physicians.  Because in my opinion the coronavirus isn’t that dangerous, and how are people going to have trust in me doing cancer pathology, much of which is related to viruses as well? But nobody is talking about that.”  We emailed Dr. Alexov several questions, including asking why he believes it’s impossible to create a vaccine against COVID-19.  He didn’t answer the questions directly. Dr. Alexov instead responded:  We also emailed five of Dr. Alexov’s colleagues in the ESP asking them to confirm Dr. Alexov’s revelations. We followed up by telephone with two of them. None responded.  Why didn’t Dr. Alexov or his five colleagues answer our questions?  We doubt it’s due to lack of English proficiency.  It’s more likely because of the pressure on pathologists to follow the WHO’s directives and not speak out publicly. And, on top of that, pathology departments depend on governments for their funding.  Nonetheless, pathologists like Drs. Alexov and Püschel appear to be willing to step out and say that no one has died from a novel-coronavirus infection.  Perhaps that’s because pathologists’ records and reputations are based on hard physical evidence rather than on subjective interpretation of tests, signs and symptoms. And there is no hard physical evidence that COVID-19 is deadly.

3c791c29,Why Did 21 Million Phone Numbers Disappear from China After Coronavirus Outbreak?,"As the coronavirus pandemic continues to devastate the world in ways no one ever imagined, some are questioning whether China is lying about the extent of COVID-19’s impact on its own country.  Officially, China reported nearly 82,000 cases of the coronavirus and around 3,300 deaths, with only a handful of new cases each day, and announced the country is largely in recovery as China ended its lockdown of Wuhan, the city of 11 million people where the outbreak began. In comparison, the United States reported nearly 500,000 cases of the coronavirus around the country and more than 18,000 deaths by the disease – a figure some officials even believe is under-reported, despite grossly surpassing the numbers coming out of China.    Advertisement    So when major cellphone carriers in China reported a loss in nearly 21 million subscriptions in January and February, some skeptics theorized that the number of phone numbers that disappeared from the original hotspot of the disease may correlate to the real number of lives lost to the novel coronavirus.  According to data published by the mobile carriers, China Mobile Ltd. saw a drop of nearly 7.25 million subscribers and China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. lost 7.8 million subscribers in January and February, while China Telecom Corp. lost 5.6 million subscribers in February alone, the Associated Press reported.  China affairs expert Tang Jinyuan explained that having a cellphone and a cell subscription is married to daily life in China. “Dealing with the government for pensions and social security, buying train tickets, shopping … no matter what people want to do, they are required to use cellphones,” she said in an interview with the Epoch Times.    Advertisement    So does the sudden drop in subscribers necessarily point to the number of coronavirus-related fatalities in China? Dr. Samantha Hoffman, an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, says no.  “I don’t think those pieces of information prove anything at this point,” Hoffman told InsideEdition.com. “There are a lot of indicators that the numbers are wrong, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say that the telephone … data is proof of anything. I think that it’s too early to answer those questions.”  The number of cell phone subscribers could have dropped as businesses shuttered and work phone plans were cancelled, according to the Associated Press. Or, migrant workers may have cancelled their phone subscription for the region in which they worked when they weren’t able to return after leaving for their home region for Lunar New Year holidays, an analyst told Bloomberg.      Advertisement    However, Hoffman does believe that the state-released data is most likely not reflective of the real number of cases and deaths related to the coronavirus. “I think that the likelihood of these numbers being falsified is pretty high in my view,” she said. “To what degree? I’m not sure.”  She is not alone in believing that China’s data is falsified. U.S. intelligence officials also reported that China concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, according to both the New York Times and Fortune Magazine.  Hoffman explained factors other than the drop in cell phone subscriptions point to her conclusion, the most obvious one being China’s “long history of lying about death tolls.”        Another reason she believed the numbers were falsified goes back to the failures of China’s social credit system, a ranking system based on the reputation of each citizen and business. “It’s a system that uses technology to augment existing forms of social and political control,” Hoffman said.  Similar to how each person has a credit score in the United States, a Chinese citizen’s social credit score can move up and down depending on their positive or negative behavior, like failing to pay debts, being convicted of crimes or even smoking in non-smoking areas. Someone with a poor social credit score could be restricted from flights or trains, barred from receiving high-speed internet or be rejected from entrance to the most elite schools, according to Business Insider.  In the wake of the coronavirus, citizens were required to report their travel and medical history, and their answer would factor into their social credit score. “In Beijing for instance, anybody returning from overseas failing to report or misreport their health condition would be included,” Hoffman explained.  However, people are also penalized in the social credit system for spreading fake news or rumors, which could be problematic in China, where there the line between the distinction of spreading rumors and alerting the public to a potential pandemic such as the coronavirus is blurred.  “Spreading rumors is such a politicized charge in the [People’s Republic of China]. Are there people spreading false rumors? Yeah, probably there are in every country … but the problem is how do you define that? And for the [Chinese Communist] Party that could just be whistle-blowing,” Hoffman said. “I think that’s actually more concerning because we already know that there were people who were trying to get the word out about the crisis back when it seemed the party was concealing the severity of the outbreak.”  For those reasons, Hoffman said, it’s hard to gauge the real number of coronavirus cases and deaths in China, despite some social media claims that the number of deaths could be as high as ten times the officially reported figure.  And the implications of China’s potential false reporting could be why we see some countries devastated by the coronavirus, Hoffman said.  “It definitely impacted a global response and how seriously governments were taking this as a threat and how serious people were taking it as a threat as they chose to continue traveling or chose to continue living their normal lives,” she said. “Those are decisions that would have potentially been changed, had information been clear earlier on.”  U.S. officials agreed. “The data set matters … [saving lives] depends on the ability to have confidence and information about what actually transpired,” U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement to press.  “The reality is we could have been better off if China has been more forthcoming,” Vice President Mike Pence told CNN.  And as America continues to grapple with its own outbreak, with an apex more imminent with each passing day, Hoffman’s concern is with the long-term effects of China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.  “In the long term, this technology for collecting data for the social credit system can be a lot more problematic and a lot more powerful,” Hoffman said. “There are a lot of risks, and all of it points to the [Chinese Communist] Party using technology to better expand its power. I think we just sort of had a glimpse of what that looks like with this crisis.”",false
fe6a9262,Belgium Health Minister puts ban on non-essential sexual activities of persons 3 or greater in indoor areas,"Belgium Health Minister Maggie de Block has put a ban on all non-essential sexual activities of persons 3 or greater in indoor areas.  Health Minister de Block announced today that, effective immediately, “non-essential” sexual activities of 3 people or more are banned in Belgium to combat the spread of COVID-19.  De Block said she was forced to act swiftly because of Belgium’s reputation as being the “beer-drinking” and “group sex capital of Europe.”  “Belgium is the beer-drinking and group sex capital of Europe, if not the world. We, as a nation, must address this situation,” De Block announced in Parliament.  Belgium Health minister has put a ban on all sexual activities of three people or more after a coronavirus party last week turned into a 500-participant orgy and ended with 380 cases of contamination.  “Wife swapping, threesomes, and orgies of six, fifty, one hundred or more are not permitted until the outbreak settles down,” she announced in Parliament.  Health minister De Block did not ban single or two-person sexual practices such as masturbation, anal or oral sex, or even bestiality.  “These measures apply only to human-to-human sexual contact, not human-to-animal contact,” she added when questioned about bestiality by reporters.  A 2018 survey revealed that more than 78% of Belgian couples openly practice wife swapping, a cultural trait that became common practice in the 19th century under the rule of King Leopold II.  .",false

ae0c3741,New State Budget Is New Yorkers’ Worst Nightmare,"Senate Democrats Fail Taxpayers, Local Governments, Job Seekers, and Middle-Class Families; Instead, they Deliver for Criminals, Illegal Immigrants, and the Far Left Fringe  Crafted entirely by Democrats in total control of New York’s new one-party government, the 2019-20 state budget includes billions of dollars in new taxes and spending that will make it even more difficult for hardworking, middle-class taxpayers to provide for their families and make ends meet.  The budget includes a multitude of unfunded mandates that will drastically hamper the viability of local governments, and will also enact catastrophic changes to New York’s criminal justice system which will enhance the rights of dangerous criminals over law-abiding citizens.  “After months of warning about the disastrous effects of one-party government, New York’s worst nightmare has been realized with the 2019-20 state budget. Not only have Senate Democrats betrayed the hardworking taxpayers they are supposed to represent – they have focused virtually all of their energy on delivering for criminals and illegal immigrants, and appeasing the radical, socialist fringe that now controls their party. By voting for this disastrous spending plan, Democrats have totally turned their backs on local governments and middle-class families struggling through New York’s growing affordability crisis. Our great state deserves a much better budget,” said Senate Republican Leader John J. Flanagan.  New taxes and fees to be enacted by Senate Democrats in the state budget include:  A new tax on internet purchases, with an overwhelming majority of the revenue raised to be funneled to fund New York City priorities;  A new tax on prescription drugs and medications, which would harm seniors and our most vulnerable populations;  A new commuter tax that will hurt motorists in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island;  A new tax on driving that will devastate Upstate New York’s tourism industry;  A new tax on real estate transactions;  A new grocery bag tax, which will require anyone who needs food or other basic necessities to dig a little deeper into their pockets; and  A planned taxpayer-funded political campaign system, AKA “welfare for politicians,” through actions to be implemented by a commission which will ultimately require taxpayer dollars to fund negative campaign mailers and robocalls.  Senate Democrats once promised they wouldn’t raise taxes, but instead picked up right where they left off in 2009-10, when they raised taxes and fees 124 times, totaling $14 billion in just two years. The fiscally irresponsible trend continues today with the imminent passage of the state budget, as Senate Democrats are approving billions in new taxes that are still being tabulated. On top of accelerating the affordability crisis plaguing millions of New Yorkers who have been forced to leave for more affordable areas of the country, the spending plan does nothing to address the Senate Democrats’ outright rejection of the Amazon HQ2 plan, which cost New York 25,000 new jobs and $27 billion in new revenue.  The budget includes no increase in CHIPs funding and cuts to extreme winter recovery funds by $65 million, while fronting the MTA $100 million to pave the way for implementation of the new commuter tax. It also cuts AIM funding by $59 million, and for the first time ever, the budget awards Governor Cuomo with $5 million in bullet aid.  Since the beginning of the 2019 session, Senate Republicans have offered various amendments and proposals to these job-killing tax-and-spend policies, including:  Balancing the budget without raising or creating new taxes and fees;  Enshrining the state spending cap into law, which would ensure that Democrats can never again blow past fiscally responsible levels concerning how they spend the taxpayer dollar;  Accelerating and protecting the historic Middle Class Income Tax Cut previously enacted by Senate Republicans, which has already saved New Yorkers $770 million, and is one of the largest and most important tax cuts in state history;  Implementing significant business and energy tax cuts and regulatory reforms, so that there are fewer obstacles to creating new jobs in New York;  Reforming the voting procedure for the Public Authorities Control Board to require a majority vote on economic development projects, so that any one Senator can never again single-handedly cost New York thousands of jobs and billions in new revenue due to political considerations.  Despite many assurances by the Governor and Democrats in the Legislature, the state budget fails to reject various unfunded mandates, and most notably excludes adequate funding needed to implement the state’s early voting mandate. The New York State Board of Elections estimates that early voting will cost $175 million, a number far greater than the $25 million local governments will receive from the state. This reckless action will put additional pressure on towns, villages, and counties to raise taxes or cut essential services.  “We’re one of the few states experiencing a decrease in population and, in a recent survey, nearly half of our young people said they are on their way out. Our next generation of entrepreneurs, local leaders, and families are set to flee the state and this budget will not change their minds. The budget increases taxes, does nothing to help struggling small businesses, ignores our upstate roads, and slaps more unfunded mandates on local governments. Improving affordability and boosting economic development were my priorities at the start of the budget process and this plan falls flat on both concerns,” said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Republican Senator James L. Seward.  Passed annually, the New York State Budget is supposed to be as much a reflection of policy values as it is about being fiscally responsible with taxpayer money. Because of the new one-party government in New York, other Democrat-driven priorities that made it into the final budget include:  Fully funding an initiative to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrants, while rejecting an increase in Tuition Assistance Program funding that would help middle-class families afford college;  Allowing cashless bail, which will let violent, hardened criminals out onto the streets with no consequence or regard for public safety;  Disproportionately underfunding school aid, with a far greater amount dedicated to New York City schools, effectively shorting aid for every other part of the state; and  Keeping the Hollywood Film Tax Credit, despite Senate Democrats’ previous opposition to corporate incentives, such as for Amazon HQ2.  After being negotiated with little to no transparency for months by leaders of the new one-party government without garnering input from members of the minorities in both houses, passage of the 2019-20 state budget will garner an overwhelming majority of its yes votes from Democrats and New York City-located officials. The budget will create and raises taxes and spending by billions despite previous claims from the Governor’s Budget Director and Comptroller that the state was facing a multi-billion dollar deficit.",partially false
